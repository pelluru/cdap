   * Returns whether escaping is enabled. Default is false.
   *
   * When escaping is enabled, any character can be escaped with a backslash '\'. For example, with escaping enabled,
   * '\${val}' would evaluate to '${val}'. With escaping disabled, '\${val}' would result in a lookup of 'val'.
   * If the lookup for 'val' is 'xyz', the entire macro would evaluate to '\xyz'. Before enabling escaping on a field,
   * keep in mind that an escape enabled macro field will behave differently than a non-macro field.
   * In a non-macro field, '\n' will be evaluated as-is. In an escape enabled macro field, '\n' will evaluate
   * to 'n'.
   *
   * When escaping is disabled, certain values cannot be expressed. For example, a literal '${val}' cannot be used,
   * since it will always be interpreted as a macro lookup. Similarly, '${${val}}' will not be a lookup on
   * key '${val}', but will be a lookup on whatever '${val}' evaluates to.
