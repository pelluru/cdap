/**
 * Interface to be implemented to handle HTTP requests. This interface can be implemented and passed along to
 * custom user services. Classes that implement this interface can add methods with the {@link Path @Path} annotation
 * to specify the endpoint which that method handles. It can also use the {@link GET @GET}, {@link POST @POST},
 * {@link PUT @PUT}, {@link DELETE @DELETE} annotations to specify the type of HTTP requests that it handles.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 *   <pre><code>
 *      public class MyHttpHandler implements HttpServiceHandler {
 *
 *        {@literal @}GET
 *        {@literal @}Path("/ping")
 *        public void process(HttpServiceRequest request, HttpServiceResponder responder) {
 *          responder.sendString("Hello World");
 *        }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void configure(HttpServiceConfigurer configurer) { }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void initialize(HttpServiceContext context) throws Exception { }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void destroy() { }
 *      }
 *   </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * To handle HTTP request with large body, it is better to have the handler method to return
 * a {@link HttpContentConsumer} to avoid running out of memory. Similarly, to return a response
 * with a large body, it is preferable to return respond with {@link HttpContentProducer}.
 *
 * By default, all handler methods are executed within an implicit transaction, that is, you
 * can access datasets and perform transactional data operations from the handler method.
 * In some cases, for example, if the handler does not need to perform data operations, or if
 * the time it takes to complete all operations may exceed the transaction timeout, it is
 * better to annotate the method with a different transaction policy, for example:
 * <p>
 *        {@literal @}GET
 *        {@literal @}Path("/ping")
 *        {@literal @}TransactionPolicy(TransactionControl.EXPLICIT)
 *        public void process(HttpServiceRequest request, HttpServiceResponder responder) {
 *          getContext().execute(60, new TxRunnable() {
 *            // perform data operations
 *          });
 *          responder.sendString("Hello World");
 *        }
 * </p>
 *
 * @see HttpContentConsumer
 * @see HttpContentProducer
