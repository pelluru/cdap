/**
 * Annotates a {@link co.cask.cdap.api.flow.flowlet.Flowlet Flowlet's} method to indicate that it will process
 * its input in batch.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, a Flowlet processes a single data object at a time within a single transaction. To increase throughput, 
 * you can process a batch of data objects within the same transaction: 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}Batch(100)
 * {@literal @}ProcessInput
 * public void process(Iterator{@literal <}String> words) {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In this example, 100 data objects are dequeued at one time and processed within a single transaction.
 * Note that the signature of the method in the above example has an {@link java.util.Iterator} over the input type.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You could also keep the argument as an individual input type:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}Batch(100)
 * {@literal @}ProcessInput
 * public void process(String word) {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * By doing so, the process method will be called repeatedly by the system for each input in the dequeued batch within
 * single transaction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The batch size can also be controlled through flowlet properties or runtime arguments. You can specify the key to use
 * for looking up the batch size value with a {@code @Batch} annotation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}Batch(key = "batch.size", value = 100)
 * {@literal @}ProcessInput
 * public void process(String word) {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * By specifying the {@code key} element in the {@code @Batch} annotation, the runtime system will resolve the
 * batch size in this order (highest precedence first):
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Runtime argument with name = {@code flowlet.<flowletName>.<key>}</li>
 *   <li>Runtime argument with name = {@code flowlet.*.<key>}</li>
 *   <li>Runtime argument with name = {@code <key>}</li>
 *   <li>Flowlet properties with name = {@code <key>}</li>
 *   <li>The {@code value} element specified in the {@code @Batch} annotation</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you use batch processing, your transactions can take longer and the probability of a conflict due
 * to a failed process increases (see {@link HashPartition hash partitioning}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * See the <i><a href="http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/index.html">CDAP Developers' Manual</a></i>
 * for more information.
 * </p>
