/**
 * Represents a dataset that is split into partitions that can be uniquely addressed
 * by partition keys along multiple dimensions. Each partition is a path in a file set,
 * the partition key attached as meta data. Note that the partitioning of the dataset
 * is fixed, that is, all operations that accept a partition key as a parameter require
 * that that key has exactly the same schema as the partitioning.
 *
 * This dataset can be made available for querying with SQL (explore). This is enabled through dataset
 * properties when the dataset is created. See {@link FileSetProperties}
 * for details. If it is enabled for explore, a Hive external table will be created when the dataset is
 * created. The Hive table is partitioned by the same keys as this dataset.
