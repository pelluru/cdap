/**
 * Annotates a {@link ProgramLifecycle} method to indicate that it will not run inside transaction.
 * 
 * By default, program life cycle methods ({@link ProgramLifecycle#initialize(RuntimeContext) initialize},
 * {@link ProgramLifecycle#destroy() destroy}), are run inside a transaction. Some methods do not require a
 * transaction, or they need to control their transactions themselves. Such a method can be annotated,
 * for example in a worker, with:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}Override
 * {@literal @}TransactionPolicy(TransactionControl.EXPLICIT)
 * public void initialize(WorkerContext context) {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This is especially useful if the method may run longer than the transaction timeout, and it would then
 * fail if run inside a transaction.
