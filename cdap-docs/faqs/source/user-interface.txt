User Interface
==============

Does CDAP support CORS?
-----------------------
CORS (`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/>`__) is 
currently not supported in CDAP. 

If you were interested in using CORS to create a webapp that showed information about CDAP
gathered through the RESTful APIs, a workaround would be the method used for the CDAP UI.
Make backend requests through a `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__ server and route the
response to the client browser. Here, the Node.js server acts as a proxy and from it you
can call the CDAP RESTful end points without any issues of cross-domain.
