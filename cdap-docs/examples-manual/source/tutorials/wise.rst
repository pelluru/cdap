CDAP Tutorial: WISE (Web InSights Engine) Application
=====================================================

**A Case Study of Web Analytics using the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP)**

Introduction
============
Performing analytics on a Web application using access logs is a common use case when
managing a Web site. A system capable of analytics needs to ingest logs, and implement
real-time or batch processing computations to process the data. The information has to be
stored somewhere in the system, and the system should expose ways to retrieve it. Even in
this case where the system performs very simple analytics, such as counting the number of
visits made to a website in a day, the components needed to make it possible demand a lot
of work.

Using the **Web Insights Engine** application or *WISE*, we’ll show you how to build
such a system on CDAP that is easy, concise, and powerful. WISE extracts value from Web
server access logs, counts visits made by different IP addresses seen in the logs in
real time, and computes the bounce ratio of each web page encountered using batch
processing.

The WISE v\ |cdap-apps-version| application uses these Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) constructs to
analyze web server logs:

- **Stream:** Ingests log data in real time
- **Flow:** Computes web page visits counts per IP address based on the log data in real time
- **Datasets:** Store web page visits counts and bounce ratio based on custom data access patterns
- **MapReduce:** Computes the bounce ratio of each web page present in the log data
- **Service:** Exposes HTTP APIs to query the page visit counts per IP address
- **Explore:** Runs SQL queries on the data stored in datasets

Conventions
-----------

In the examples and commands that follow, for brevity we will use these conventions:

- ``<CDAP-HOME>`` is the directory that you have installed the CDAP Sandbox, either
  on a UNIX-type system or Windows.

- The :ref:`CDAP Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` is included in the CDAP Sandbox
  in the ``bin`` directory, either at ``bin/cdap cli`` or |---| on Windows |---|
  ``bin\cdap.bat cli``. The CLI allows you to quickly access CDAP facilities from a command
  line environment.

- For brevity in the commands given below, we will simply use ``cdap cli`` for the CDAP
  Command Line Interface. Substitute the actual path of ``./<CDAP-HOME>/bin/cdap cli``,
  or ``<CDAP-HOME>\bin\cdap.bat cli`` on Windows, as appropriate.

- A Windows-version of the application ``curl`` is included in the CDAP Sandbox as
  ``libexec\bin\curl.exe``; use it as a substitute for ``curl`` in examples.

- If you add the CDAP Sandbox ``bin`` directory to your path, you can simplify the commands. From within
  the ``<CDAP-HOME>`` directory, enter:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    .. Linux

    $ export PATH=${PATH}:\`pwd\`/bin

    .. Windows

    > set path=%PATH%;%CD%\bin;%CD%\libexec\bin

  The Windows path has been augmented with a directory where the CDAP Sandbox includes
  Windows-versions of commands such as ``curl``.

.. include:: ../../../developer-manual/source/_includes/windows-note.txt

.. highlight:: console

Running WISE
============
Building and running WISE v\ |cdap-apps-version| is straightforward. We’ll assume that you have
already downloaded, installed, and have started an instance of CDAP, as described in the
:ref:`CDAP Sandbox <sandbox-index>`.

Change to ``examples`` directory of the directory where you have installed the
CDAP Sandbox, and download the WISE source code:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ cd <CDAP-HOME>/examples
  $ curl -w"\n" -X GET "https://codeload.github.com/caskdata/cdap-apps/zip/release/cdap-|short-version|-compatible" \
  --output cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible.zip

Unzip the directory and change to the source directory:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  .. Linux

  $ unzip cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible.zip
  $ cd cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible/Wise

  .. Windows

  > jar xf cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible.zip
  > cd cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible\Wise

To build WISE (skipping the tests), you use:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ mvn clean package -DskipTests

(To build WISE and run the WISE example tests, you would instead use:)

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ mvn clean package

To deploy and start the application, make sure CDAP is running and then execute:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ cd <CDAP-HOME>
  $ cdap cli deploy app examples/cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible/Wise/target/cdap-wise-|cdap-apps-version|.jar
  $ cdap cli start flow Wise.WiseFlow
  $ cdap cli start service Wise.WiseService

You should get responses similar to::

  Successfully connected CDAP instance at http://localhost:11015
  Successfully started flow 'WiseFlow' of application 'Wise' with stored runtime arguments '{}'
  ...
  Successfully started service 'WiseService' of application 'Wise' with stored runtime arguments '{}'


Overview of WISE
================
Throughout this case study, we will present and explain the different constructs that the
WISE application uses. Let’s first have a look at a diagram showing an overview of the
WISE application’s architecture:

.. image:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/wise_architecture_diagram.png
   :width: 8in
   :align: center

- The WISE application has one stream, ``logEventStream``, which receives Web server
  access logs. It sends the events it receives to two CDAP components: the
  flow ``WiseFlow`` and the workflow ``WiseWorkflow``.

- ``WiseFlow`` has two flowlets. The first, ``parser``, extracts information from the logs
  received from the stream. It then sends the information to the second flowlet,
  ``pageViewCount``, whose role is to store the information in a custom-defined dataset,
  ``pageViewStore``.

- ``WiseWorkflow`` executes a MapReduce every ten minutes. The input of this job are events
  from the stream which have not yet been processed by the workflow. For each web page
  recorded in the access logs, the MapReduce counts the number of times people have
  “bounced” from it. A “bounce” is counted whenever a user’s activity stops for a specified
  amount of time. The last page they visited is counted as a bounce. This information is
  stored in the dataset ``bounceCountStore``.

- The WISE application contains the ``WiseService``, a service which exposes RESTful endpoints
  to query the ``pageViewStore`` dataset.

- Finally, both the ``pageViewStore`` and ``bounceCountStore`` datasets expose a SQL interface. They
  can be queried using SQL queries through our Explore module in the CDAP UI.

Now let’s talk about each of these components in more detail.


WISE Data Patterns
==================
Here’s a sample access log (reformatted to fit)::

  255.255.255.185 - - [23/Sep/2014:11:45:38 -0400] "GET /cdap.html HTTP/1.0" 401 2969 " "
    "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)"

WISE is only interested in three parts of a log:

- The IP address: **255.255.255.185**
- The time the log was saved: **23/Sep/2014:11:45:38 -0400**
- The web page visited: **/cdap.html**

WISE has two datasets, *pageViewStore* and *bounceCountStore*, which both store
information about the access logs, but according to different patterns.


.. rubric:: The *pageViewStore* Dataset

The *pageViewStore* custom dataset stores, for each IP address,
the number of times that address has visited a web page. For example, *pageViewStore* could
contain this entry::

  255.255.255.185  -> {
    /index.html  -> 3,
    /career.html -> 1,
    /cdap.html   -> 3,
    /team.html   -> 4,
    ...
  }

*pageViewStore* uses a ``Table`` object to store this information. ``Table`` is a class provided by
the CDAP system which has rows and columns. A row consists of a row key and one or more
columns with values associated with them. Two rows can have different sets of columns.
Using the ``Java Map`` interface, a ``Table`` can be seen as being of type ``Map<byte[], Map<byte[],
byte[]>>``.

*pageViewStore* uses a ``Table`` object with this pattern:

- The row key of the Table is an IP address;
- Each web page visited by the IP address is a column;
- The value of each column is the count of visits the IP address has made to the web page URI.

.. highlight:: java

*pageViewStore* is a custom dataset. It is defined in the ``PageViewStore`` class such
that it includes the use of a ``Table`` to store the data:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/PageViewStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 42-51

This is the common way of defining a custom dataset. The next step is to define the API
that this dataset exposes to store and access data. The API for storing data will be a
single method:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/PageViewStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 58-60
   :dedent: 2

``incrememtCount()`` takes a ``LogInfo`` object, which contains those three parts of a log that we
are interested in |---| IP address, timestamp, and web page |---| and increments the number of
visits of the web page for that IP address. We use the underlying ``Table``‘s ``increment()``
method to store this information.

Let’s look at how to make the data available through our *pageViewStore* dataset:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/PageViewStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 80-90
   :dedent: 2

This method returns the total number of visits an IP address has made. To do so, it uses
the ``Table.get()`` method, which returns a Row object containing all the columns associated
to the row key passed as argument of ``Table.get()``.


.. rubric:: The *bounceCountStore* Dataset

The *bounceCountStore* dataset stores the total number of visits for each web page, along
with the number of times users bounced off of them.

Data is stored in a ``Table`` object with the pattern:

- The row key is the web page URI;
- Each row has two columns: the byte arrays COL_VISITS and COL_BOUNCES;
- The COL_VISITS column stores the total number of visits for the web page considered; and
- The COL_BOUNCES column stores the number of times users bounced off the web page.

Let’s detail the API exposed by the *bounceCountStore* dataset to store this information:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 39-63

The ``increment()`` method adds to a web page the number of “visits” and “bounces”, using the
``Table.increment()`` method to do so.

To retrieve the number of “visits” and “bounces” for a particular web page, we define a
``get()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 71-79
   :dedent: 2

The ``get()`` method reads the two columns ``COL_VISITS`` and ``COL_BOUNCES`` of a web page. Once
again, we use the ``Table.get()`` method which returns a ``Row`` object. From the information
contained in the ``Row`` object, we build a ``PageBounce`` object, a simple POJO class, containing
a ``uri``, a ``visits`` count and a ``bounces`` count.


Ingesting Access Logs in WISE
=============================
CDAP has an easy way to ingest data in real time into an application, using streams. A
stream exposes a simple RESTful API to ingest data events.

.. highlight:: console

In WISE, each Web server access log is injected as a stream event to the *logEventStream* in
this format (broken on two lines to fit)::

  47.41.156.173 - - [18/Sep/2014:12:52:52 -0400] "POST /index.html HTTP/1.1" 404 1490 " "
    "Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; Ask Jeeves)"

We have already prepared a sample of Web server access logs for you to inject into the
*logEventStream*. Run this command from the CDAP Sandbox home directory:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

   $ cd <CDAP-HOME>
   $ cdap cli load stream logEventStream examples/cdap-apps-release-cdap-|short-version|-compatible/Wise/resources/apache.accesslog text/plain

   Successfully loaded file to stream 'logEventStream'


This requires that a CDAP Sandbox instance be running with the WISE application already
deployed.


Real-Time Log Analytics with WiseFlow
=====================================
The goal of ``WiseFlow`` is to perform real-time analytics on the Web server access logs
received by *logEventStream*. For each IP address in the logs, ``WiseFlow`` counts the
number of visits they made to different web pages.

This work is realized by two flowlets, *parser* and *pageViewCount*.


.. rubric:: The *parser* Flowlet

The *parser* flowlet (of type ``LogEventParserFlowlet``) receives the raw log data from
the stream and extracts useful information from it. Here is its implementation:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseFlow.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 53-77
   :dedent: 2

A ``Flowlet`` class extends ``AbstractFlowlet``. The ``LogEventParserFlowlet`` class contains one
method to process the data it receives from *logEventStream*. This method can have any name;
here, we call it *processFromStream*. It has to bear the ``@ProcessInput`` annotation indicating
that the method will be used to process incoming data.

Because the *parser* flowlet receives data from a stream, the *processFromStream* method has
to take one and only one argument of type ``StreamEvent``. A ``StreamEvent`` object contains the
header and the body of a stream event. In the WISE application, the body of a ``StreamEvent``
will be a Web server access log.

The *parser* flowlet parses every log it receives into one ``LogInfo`` object. Using an
``OutputEmitter<LogInfo>`` object, *parser* outputs those logs to the next flowlet input |---| the
*pageViewCount* flowlet. When a ``LogInfo`` object is emitted, it is hashed by IP address. We’ll
see below why this is useful.


.. rubric:: The *pageViewCount* Flowlet

The *pageViewCount* flowlet (of type ``PageViewCounterFlowlet``) receives ``LogInfo``
objects and updates the *pageViewStore* dataset with the information they contain.

Its implementation is very brief:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseFlow.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 82-99
   :dedent: 2

Here’s what to note about the ``PageViewCounterFlowlet`` flowlet class:

- The ``@ProcessInput`` annotation on the ``count()`` method indicates that ``count()`` will process
  incoming data.
- The ``@UseDataSet`` annotation gives a reference to the *pageViewStore* dataset
  above the *pageViewStore* attribute. The dataset APIs can then be used inside the ``count()``
  method to store logs analytics.
- The ``@Batch`` annotation indicates that data is processed in batches of ten ``LogInfo``
  objects, which increases the throughput of the flowlet.
- The ``@HashPartition`` annotation ensures, in the case that several instances of this flowlet are
  running, all ``LogInfo`` objects with the same IP address information will be sent to
  the same flowlet instance. This prevents two flowlet instances from writing to the same
  row key of the *pageViewStore* dataset at the same time, which would cause a transaction
  conflict. (See the :ref:`CDAP Developer Manual: Transaction System <transaction-system>`
  for more information about transactions and conflicts.)

Building the WiseFlow
---------------------
Now that we have had a look at the core of the *parser* and *pageViewCount* flowlets,
let’s see how they are connected together and to the *logEventStream*.

The flowlets are defined in the ``WiseFlow`` flow, which is defined by this small class:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseFlow.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 37-47

In the ``configure()`` method of the ``WiseFlow`` flow, we define the flowlets, giving them names:

- *parser*, of type ``LogEventParserFlowlet``; and
- *pageViewCount*, of type ``PageViewCounterFlowlet``.

We also define the graph of their connections:

- *logEventStream* stream is connected to the *parser* flowlet; and
- *parser* flowlet is connected to the *pageViewCount* flowlet.

Here is how ``WiseFlow`` looks in the CDAP UI:

.. image:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/wise_flow.png
   :width: 8in
   :align: center


Batch Processing with WiseWorkflow
==================================
WISE executes every ten minutes a MapReduce program that computes the bounce counts of the
web pages seen in the Web server access logs.

The ``BounceCountsMapReduce`` class defines the MapReduce to run. It extends
``AbstractMapReduce`` and overrides the two methods ``configure()`` and ``initialize()``.
The ``configure()`` method is defined as:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountsMapReduce.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 42-49
   :append: . . .

It sets the ID (name) of the MapReduce program as *BounceCountsMapReduce*, and specifies any datasets
that will be used in the program.

Plugging a Stream to the Input of the MapReduce
-----------------------------------------------
Traditionally in a MapReduce program, a Job configuration is set before each run. This is
done in the ``initialize()`` method of the ``BounceCountsMapReduce`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountsMapReduce.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 50-83
   :dedent: 2

As mentioned earlier, the input of the MapReduce is the *logEventStream*. This
connection is made above using the ``context.addInput(Input.ofStream())`` methods.

This MapReduce program runs as part of a workflow that is scheduled every ten minutes.
Every time it runs, it reads ten minutes' worth of events from the stream, ending at the
logical start time of the job (the same as the scheduled time of the containing workflow).

Writing to the *bounceCountStore* dataset from the MapReduce
------------------------------------------------------------
In the ``BounceCountsMapReduce.initialize()`` method seen earlier, the ``context.addOutput()``
method sets the ``bounceCountsStore`` dataset as the output of the job.
It means that the key/value pairs output by the reducer of the MapReduce will be directly
written to that dataset.

To allow that, the ``bounceCountsStore`` dataset has to implement the ``BatchWritable``
interface:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 39-41
   :append:   . . .

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 96-99
   :prepend:   . . .

This ``BatchWritable`` interface, defining a ``write()`` method, is intended to allow datasets to
be the output of MapReduce programs. The two generic types that it takes as parameters must
match the types of the key and value that the Reduce part of the MapReduce outputs. In this
case, the *bounceCountStore* dataset can be used as output of a MapReduce where the
output key is of type ``Void``, and the output value is of type ``PageBounce``.

MapReduce Structure
-------------------
The Mapper of the MapReduce program receives log events as input, parses them into
``LogInfo`` objects and sends them to the Reducer. The Reducer receives the ``LogInfo``
objects grouped by IP addresses, with two logs with the same IP address sorted by
timestamp in ascending order.

Because the input of our MapReduce is a stream, it forces the key and value types of our
Mapper to be ``LongWritable`` and ``Text``, respectively.

Our Mapper and Reducer are standard Hadoop classes with these signatures:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountsMapReduce.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 88
   :prepend: . . .
   :append: . . .
   :dedent: 2

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountsMapReduce.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 109
   :prepend: . . .
   :append: . . .
   :dedent: 2

Each generic parameter of the Mapper and the Reducer contains:

- Mapper input key ``LongWritable``: the timestamp of when a stream event has been received;
- Mapper input value ``Text``: body of a stream event, in this case the log data;
- Mapper output key and Reducer input key ``LogInfo``: a POJO object containing information
  about one log line;
- Mapper output value and Reducer input value ``IntWritable``: a simple placeholder as we
  don’t use its content;
- Reducer output key ``Void``: this is not used; and
- Reducer output value ``PageBounce``: bounce counts of a web page.

Scheduling the MapReduce
------------------------
To schedule the ``BounceCountsMapReduce`` to run every ten minutes, we define it in the
``WiseWorkflow`` using its name:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseWorkflow.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 21-

The ``WiseWorkflow`` can then be scheduled in the ``WiseApp``:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseApp.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 47-51
   :prepend: . . .
   :append: . . .
   :dedent: 4

You can manually run the ``WiseWorkflow`` using

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ cdap cli start workflow Wise.WiseWorkflow

  Successfully started workflow 'WiseWorkflow' of application 'Wise'
  with stored runtime arguments '{}'


Accessing Data through WiseService
==================================
``WiseService`` is a WISE component that exposes specific HTTP endpoints to retrieve the
content of the *pageViewStore* dataset. For example, ``WiseService`` defines this endpoint::

  GET /v3/namespaces/default/apps/Wise/services/WiseService/methods/ip/<ip-address>/count

Using the ``curl`` command and the CLI, example use of the service would be:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ curl -w"\n" -X GET "http://localhost:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/Wise/services/WiseService/methods/ip/255.255.255.185/count"
  21

  $ cdap cli call service Wise.WiseService GET ip/255.255.255.185/count

  < 200 OK
  < Content-Length: 2
  < Connection: keep-alive
  < Content-Type: application/json
  21

This endpoint is defined in a class extending ``AbstractHttpServiceHandler``:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseService.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 46-68
   :dedent: 2

The ``PageViewCountHandler`` class accesses the *pageViewStore* dataset using the same
``@UseDataSet`` annotation used in the ``PageViewCounterFlowlet`` class.

The endpoint defined above in the ``getIPCount()`` method will retrieve the number of times a
given IP address has been seen in the access logs by using the APIs of the *pageViewStore*
dataset.

The ``@GET`` annotation specifies the HTTP method used to reach the endpoint. The ``@Path``
annotation defines the URL path used to reach this endpoint. This path has a single user
parameter: ``{ip}``. It is decoded as a ``String`` in the parameters of the ``getIPCount()``
method with the help of the ``@PathParam`` annotation.

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseService.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 36-41

- The class sets the ID of the service, and this ID will be used in the URL to reach the
  endpoints defined by the service.
- The ``PageViewCountHandler`` that responds to the HTTP endpoint exposed by the service
  is specified by the ``addHandler()`` method.

You can use a ``curl`` command to make calls to the service URL. For example, to query total pageview count
from IP ``255.255.255.207``:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ curl -w"\n" -X GET "http://localhost:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/Wise/services/WiseService/methods/ip/255.255.255.207/count"
  22

The ``PageViewCountHandler`` has another endpoint for retrieving the pageview count of a particular page from
a specific IP address. For example, to query the pageview count of page ``/index.html`` from IP ``255.255.255.154``:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ curl -w"\n" -X POST -d "/index.html" "http://localhost:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/Wise/services/WiseService/methods/ip/255.255.255.154/count"
  2


Exploring Datasets through SQL
==============================
With WISE, you can explore the datasets using SQL queries. The SQL interface on CDAP,
called *Explore*, can be accessed through the CDAP UI:

1. After deploying WISE in your CDAP Sandbox instance, go to the *WISE*
   :cdap-ui-apps:`overview page <Wise/overview/status>`:

   .. figure:: ../_images/wise_overview.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image

#. Click on the *Datasets* tab to display the list of datasets used by WISE:

   .. figure:: ../_images/wise_datasets.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image

#. Click on *bouncecountstore*, and then the *Explore* tab:

   .. figure:: ../_images/wise_bouncecountstore.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image

This is the **Explore** tab, where you can run ad-hoc SQL queries and see information about
the datasets that expose a SQL interface.

You will notice that the datasets have names such as *dataset_bouncecountstore*.
Those are the SQL table names of the datasets which have a SQL interface.

Here are some of the SQL queries that you can run:

- Retrieve the web pages from which IP addresses have bounced more than 10% of the time::

    SELECT uri FROM dataset_bouncecountstore WHERE bounces > 0.1 * totalvisits

- Retrieve all the IP addresses which visited the page ‘/contact.html’::

    SELECT key FROM dataset_pageviewstore WHERE array_contains(map_keys(value),'/contact.html')=TRUE

As the SQL engine that CDAP runs internally is Hive, the SQL language used to submit
queries is HiveQL. A description of it is in the `Hive language manual
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML#LanguageManualDML-InsertingdataintoHiveTablesfromqueries>`__.

Let’s take a look at the schemas of the *bounceCountStore* dataset. The *Explore* interface
shows that it has three columns: ``uri``, ``totalvisits``, and ``bounces``.

To understand how we managed to attach this schema to the *bounceCountStore* dataset, let’s
have another look at the dataset’s class definition:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/BounceCountStore.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 39-41
   :append:     . . .

The ``RecordScannable`` interface allows a dataset to be queried using SQL. It exposes a
dataset as a table of ``Record`` objects, and the schema of the ``Record`` defines the schema of
the dataset as seen as a SQL table.

The *bounceCountStore* dataset’s ``Record`` type is ``PageBounce``, which is a POJO object
containing three attributes: ``uri``, ``totalVisits``, and ``bounces``. It explains where the schema
of the *bounceCountStore* is derived.

Bringing the Components Together
================================
To create the WISE application with all these components mentioned above, define a class
that extends ``AbstractApplication``:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseApp.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 28-

When the WISE application is deployed in CDAP, this class is read by the CDAP system. All
the components it defines are then installed, and can reference one another.

Unit Testing WISE
=================
Unit tests are a major part of the development of an application. As
developers ourselves, we have created a full unit testing framework for CDAP applications.
In a CDAP application unit tests, all CDAP components run in-memory.

The ``WiseAppTest`` class, which extends the unit-testing framework’s ``TestBase``, tests all the
components of the *WiseApp*. The first step is to obtain an ``ApplicationManager`` object:

.. literalinclude:: /../target/_includes/tutorial-wise/WiseAppTest.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // Deploy an App
   :end-before: // Start a Flow
   :dedent: 4

With this object, we can:
