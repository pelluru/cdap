=============
Spark K-Means
=============

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) example demonstrating Spark.


Overview
========
This example demonstrates a Spark application performing streaming analysis, computing the centers of points from an
input stream using the K-Means Clustering method.

Data from a sample file is sent to CDAP by a CDAP CLI command to the *pointsStream*. This data is
processed by the ``PointsFlow``, which stores the points coordinates event in its entirety in *points*, an ObjectStore dataset.

As these entries are created, they are taken up by the *SparkKMeansProgram*, which
goes through the entries, calculates centers and tabulates results in another ObjectStore dataset, *centers*.

Once the application completes, you can query the *centers* dataset by using the ``centers/{index}`` endpoint
of the *CentersService*. It will respond with the center's coordinates based on the ``index`` parameter (e.g. "9.1,9.1,9.1").

Let's look at some of these components, and then run the application and see the results.

The *SparkKMeans* Application
-----------------------------
As in the other `examples <index.html>`__, the components
of the application are tied together by the class ``SparkKMeansApp``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/SparkKMeans/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/sparkkmeans/SparkKMeansApp.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 52-84
   :append: . . .

The *points* and *centers* ObjectStore Data Storage
---------------------------------------------------
The raw points data is stored in an ObjectStore dataset, *points*.
The calculated centers data is stored in a second ObjectStore dataset, *centers*.

The *CentersService* Service
----------------------------
This service has a ``centers/{index}`` endpoint to obtain the center's coordinates of a given index.


.. Building and Starting
.. =====================
.. |example| replace:: SparkKMeans
.. |example-italic| replace:: *SparkKMeans*
.. |application-overview-page| replace:: :cdap-ui-apps-programs:`application overview page, programs tab <SparkKMeans>`

.. include:: _includes/_building-starting-running.txt


Running the Example
===================

.. Starting the Flow
.. -----------------
.. |example-flow| replace:: PointsFlow
.. |example-flow-italic| replace:: *PointsFlow*

.. include:: _includes/_starting-flow.txt

.. Starting the Service
.. --------------------
.. |example-service| replace:: CentersService
.. |example-service-italic| replace:: *CentersService*

.. include:: _includes/_starting-service.txt

Injecting Points Data
---------------------
Inject a file of points data to the stream *pointsStream* by running this command from the
CDAP Sandbox home directory, using the Command Line Interface:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ cdap cli load stream pointsStream examples/SparkKMeans/resources/points.txt

  Successfully loaded file to stream 'pointsStream'

Running the Spark Program
-------------------------
There are three ways to start the Spark program:

1. Go to the |example-italic| :cdap-ui-apps-programs:`application overview page, programs
   tab <SparkKMeans>`, click |example-service-italic| to get to the service detail
   page, then click the *Start* button; or

#. Use the Command Line Interface:

   .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap cli start spark SparkKMeans.SparkKMeansProgram "args='3'"

#. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command:

   .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X POST -d '{args="3"}' \
    "http://localhost:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/SparkKMeans/spark/SparkKMeansProgram/start"


Querying the Results
--------------------
To query the *centers* ObjectStore using the ``CentersService``, you can:

- You can use the Command Line Interface:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap cli call service SparkKMeans.CentersService GET centers/1

    306.52261306532665,306.52261306532665,793.7956448911223

- Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command. For example:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X GET "http://localhost:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/SparkKMeans/services/CentersService/methods/centers/1"

    306.52261306532665,306.52261306532665,793.7956448911223
