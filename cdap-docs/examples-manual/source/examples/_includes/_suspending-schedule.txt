  - click |example-workflow-italic| to get to the workflow detail page,
  - click on the *More* button in the upper-right to display an additional menu,
  - click on the *Schedules* menu-item to show the schedule, and then
  - click the *Pause* button (**| |**) so that the status shows as *suspended*; or

..

- From the CDAP Local Sandbox home directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap cli suspend schedule |example|.\ |example-schedule|

    Successfully suspended schedule '|example-schedule|' in app '|example|'
