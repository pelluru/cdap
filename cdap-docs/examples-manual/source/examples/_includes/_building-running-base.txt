Building and Starting
=====================

.. highlight:: console

- You can build the example as described in :ref:`Building an Example Application
  <cdap-building-running-example>`.

- Start CDAP (as described in :ref:`Starting and Stopping CDAP <start-stop-cdap>`).

- Deploy the application, as described in :ref:`Deploying an Application <cdap-building-running-deploying>`.
  For example, from the CDAP Local Sandbox home directory, use the :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>`:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap cli load artifact examples/|example-dir|/target/|example-artifact|-|release|.jar

    Successfully added artifact with name '|example-artifact|'

    $ cdap cli create app |example| |example-artifact| |release| user

    Successfully created application
