Command Line Interface. See :ref:`reference:cli` in the 
:ref:`CDAP Reference Manual<reference:reference-index>` for details.


.. rubric:: Getting a Health Check

.. _operations-health-check:

.. highlight:: console

Administrators can check the health of various services in the system.
(In these examples, substitute for ``<host>`` the host name or IP address of the CDAP server.)

- To retrieve the **health check of the CDAP UI**, make a GET request to the URI::

    http://<host>:11011/status

- To retrieve the **health check of the CDAP Router**, make a GET request to the URI::

    http://<host>:11015/status

- To retrieve the **health check of the CDAP Authentication Server**, make a GET request to
  the URI::
  
    http://<host>:10009/status

On success, the calls return a valid HTTP response with a 200 code.

- To retrieve the **health check of all the services running in YARN**, make a GET request
  to the URI::
  
    http://<host>:11015/v3/system/services

  On success, the call returns a JSON string with component names and their corresponding 
  statuses (reformatted to fit)::
  
    [{"name":"appfabric","description":"Service for managing application
      lifecycle.","status":"OK","logs":"OK","min":1,"max":1,"requested":1,"provisioned":1},
