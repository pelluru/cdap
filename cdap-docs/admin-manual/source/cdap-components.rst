CDAP Components
===============

These are the CDAP components:

- **CDAP Master:** Service for managing runtime, lifecycle and resources of CDAP applications (package *cdap-master*);
- **CDAP Router:** Service supporting HTTP RESTful endpoints for CDAP (package *cdap-gateway*);
- **CDAP Kafka:** Metrics and logging transport service, using an embedded version of *Kafka* (package *cdap-kafka*);
- **CDAP UI:** User interface for managing CDAP applications (package *cdap-ui*); and
- **CDAP Authentication Server:** Performs client authentication for CDAP when security is enabled (package *cdap-security*).

An *optional* component is available:

- **CDAP CLI:** User interface for interacting with CDAP from within a shell, similar to the HBase or bash shells (package *cdap-ui*).

Some CDAP components run on YARN, while others orchestrate “containers” in the Hadoop cluster.
The CDAP Router service starts a router instance on each of the local boxes and instantiates
one or more gateway instances on YARN as determined by the gateway service configuration.

In addition to these components, CDAP uses configuration XML files. The basic
configuration is set in the ``cdap-site.xml`` file (documented in :ref:`an appendix
<appendix-cdap-site.xml>`). This file is automatically created when you follow the
installation procedure steps detailed in later sections. You edit a version of this file
to configure CDAP to your specific requirements prior to starting CDAP services.

CDAP generates log files, following the settings in the configuration file ``logback.xml``, using
`Logback <http://logback.qos.ch/>`__. Logs (for Distributed CDAP) are located in ``/var/log/cdap``.
For CDAP Sandbox, they are located in ``<CDAP-HOME>/logs``.

If you have :ref:`CDAP Security <admin-security>` enabled, then you will have an
additional file, ``cdap-security.xml`` (documented in :ref:`an appendix
<appendix-cdap-security.xml>`), with additional settings.


Installation Summary
====================

In summary, these are the steps that you follow to install CDAP:

#. Determine your system architecture
#. Review and meet the system requirements: hardware, network, and software
#. Prepare your Hadoop cluster
#. Install the CDAP components
#. Configure the CDAP installation
#. Start CDAP services
#. Verify the CDAP installation
