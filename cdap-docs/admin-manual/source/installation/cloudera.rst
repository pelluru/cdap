===================================
Installation using Cloudera Manager
===================================

.. include:: ../_includes/installation/installation-steps-images.txt

.. rubric:: Notes

This section describes installing CDAP on Hadoop clusters managed by Cloudera Manager.

- The CDAP integration with Cloudera Manager is provided in the form of a Custom Service
  Descriptor (CSD), which *must be installed into Cloudera Manager* prior to installing CDAP.  The CSD
  contains service definitions and configurations to make Cloudera Manager "CDAP-aware."

  After the CDAP CSD has been :ref:`downloaded and installed <cloudera-installation-download>`, the CDAP service
  can then be installed via the usual Cloudera Manager methods. CDAP parcels will be available from the
  preconfigured CDAP parcel repository, and the CDAP service can be added to a cluster using the
  "Add Service" wizard.

  A new CDAP CSD is released with each CDAP minor version (for example: 4.0, 4.1, etc.) with patch
  releases as needed. The installed CSD version should always match the ``major.minor`` version of the
  CDAP Parcel.  For example, the |short-version| CSD can be used with CDAP |short-version-x|.

- If you are installing CDAP with the intention of using *replication,* see these
  instructions on :ref:`CDAP Replication <installation-replication>` *before* installing or starting CDAP.

Preparing the Cluster
=====================

Roles and Dependencies
----------------------
The CDAP CSD (`Custom Service Descriptor
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_addon_services.html#concept_qbv_3jk_bn_unique_1>`__)
consists of four mandatory roles and two optional roles:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - CSD Role
     - Description
   * - CDAP Master Service
     - Service for managing runtime, lifecycle and resources of CDAP applications
   * - CDAP Gateway/Router Service
     - Service supporting REST endpoints for CDAP
   * - CDAP Kafka Service
     - Metrics and logging transport service, using an embedded version of *Kafka*
   * - CDAP UI Service
     - User interface for managing CDAP applications
   * -
     -
   * - CDAP Security Auth Service
     - Performs client authentication for CDAP when security is enabled (*optional*)
   * - Gateway
     - `Cloudera Manager Gateway Role
       <http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_managing_roles.html>`__
       that installs the CDAP client tools (such as the *CDAP CLI*) and configuration (*optional*)

These roles map to the :ref:`CDAP components <admin-manual-cdap-components>` of the same name.

- As CDAP depends on HDFS, YARN, HBase, ZooKeeper, and (optionally) Hive and Spark, it must be installed
  on cluster host(s) with full client configurations for these dependent services.

- The CDAP Master Service role (or *CDAP Master*) must be co-located on a cluster host with an HDFS Gateway, a YARN
  Gateway, an HBase Gateway, and |---| optionally |---| Hive or Spark Gateways.

- Note that these Gateways are redundant if you are co-locating the CDAP Master role
  on a cluster host (or hosts, in the case of a deployment with high availability) with
  actual services, such as the HDFS Namenode, the YARN resource manager, or the HBase
  Master.

- Note that the CDAP Gateway/Router Service is not a `Cloudera Manager Gateway Role
  <http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_managing_roles.html>`__
  but is instead another name for the CDAP Router Service.

- CDAP also provides its own Gateway role that can be used to install CDAP client
  configurations on other hosts of the cluster.

- All services run as the ``'cdap'`` user installed by the parcel.

.. Hadoop Configuration
.. --------------------
.. include:: ../_includes/installation/hadoop-configuration.txt

#. Add additional entries to the YARN Application Classpath for Spark jobs.

   If you plan on running Spark programs from CDAP, CDAP requires that additional entries be added to
   the YARN application classpath, as the Spark installed on Cloudera Manager clusters
   is a "Hadoop-less" build and does not include Hadoop jars required by Spark.

   To resolve this, go to the CM page for your cluster, click on the YARN service, click on
   the configuration tab, and then enter ``mapreduce.application.classpath`` in the search box.
   You will see entries similar to these::

     $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/*

     $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/lib/*

     $MR2_CLASSPATH

   Copy all the entries to the ``yarn.application.classpath`` configuration for YARN on your Cluster.
   The ``yarn.application.classpath`` setting can be found by searching as mentioned above.

   Add the entries required by scrolling to the last entry in the classpath form,
   clicking the "+" button to add a new text box entry field at the end. Once you have
   added all the entries from the ``mapreduce.application.classpath`` to the
   ``yarn.application.classpath``, click on *Save*.

You can make these changes `using Cloudera Manager
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_mod_configs.html>`__.
Please restart the stale services upon seeing a prompt to do so after making the above
changes.

Create the "cdap" User
----------------------
**The CDAP system user:** As Hadoop resolves users at the NameNode, the ``cdap`` user must
be added there, or name resolution for the user will fail. With Cloudera Manager, the CDAP
installation will create the ``cdap`` user on all nodes when it is distributed or
activated on the cluster.

Note that Cloudera Manager can be configured to not add users specified in a installation.
This can be the case for installations whose IT policies or infrastructure do not allow
local user creation. If this is the case, manual creation of the ``cdap`` user on nodes
may be required.

.. HDFS Permissions
.. ----------------
.. include:: /../target/_includes/cloudera-hdfs-permissions.rst


Downloading and Distributing Packages
=====================================

**Note:** Both the :ref:`Custom Service Descriptor (CSD) <cloudera-installation-download>`
and the :ref:`CDAP Parcel <cloudera-installation-download-distribute-parcel>` must be
downloaded and installed in order to successfully install CDAP.

.. _cloudera-installation-download:

Downloading and Installing CSD
------------------------------
To install CDAP on a cluster managed by Cloudera, we have available a Custom Service
Descriptor (CSD) which you can install onto your CM server. This adds CDAP to the list of
available services which CM can install.

.. _cloudera-compatibility-matrix-end:

**Notes:**

- Cloudera Manager supports `a version of CDH no greater than its own
  <http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/pcm_cdh_cm.html>`__
  (for example, CM version 5.1 supports CDH versions less than or equal to 5.1).

- The version of the CDAP Parcel that is used should match the CSD major.minor version.

**Steps:**

#. Download the CDAP CSD by `downloading the JAR file
   <http://cask.co/downloads/#cloudera>`__.
   Details on CSDs and Cloudera Manager Extensions are `available online
   <https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki>`__.

   .. _cloudera-installation-csd:

#. Install the CSD following the instructions at Cloudera's website on `Add-on Services
   <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_mc_addon_services.html>`__,
   using the instructions given for the case of installing software in the form of a parcel.
   In this case, you install the CSD first and then install the parcel second.

#. The first time the CDAP CSD is installed, the Cloudera Management Service may prompt
   to be restarted. This is necessary for the CDAP services to be properly monitored.

.. _cloudera-installation-download-distribute-parcel:

Downloading and Installing Parcels
----------------------------------
Download and distribute the CDAP-|version| parcel. Complete instructions on parcels are
available at `Cloudera's website
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/
cm_ig_parcels.html>`__, but in summary these are the steps:

1. Installing the CSD adds the corresponding Cask parcel repository for you; however, you can
   `customize the list of repositories
   <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_ig_parcels.html#cmug_topic_7_11_5_unique_1>`__
   searched by Cloudera Manager if you need to;
#. `Download
   <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_ig_parcels.html#concept_vwq_421_yk_unique_1__section_cnx_b3y_bm_unique_1>`__
   the parcel to your Cloudera Manager server;
#. `Distribute
   <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_ig_parcels.html#concept_vwq_421_yk_unique_1__section_sty_b3y_bm_unique_1>`__
   the parcel to all the servers in your cluster; and
#. `Activate
   <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_ig_parcels.html#concept_vwq_421_yk_unique_1__section_ug1_c3y_bm_unique_1>`__

**Notes:**

- If the Cask parcel repository is inaccessible to your cluster, please see :ref:`these
  suggestions <faqs-cloudera-direct-parcel-access>`.
- The CDAP parcels are hosted at a repository determined by the CDAP version.
  For instance, the CDAP |short-version| parcel metadata is accessed by Cloudera Manager at

Installing CDAP Services
========================

These instructions show how to use the Cloudera Manager Admin Console *Add Service* Wizard
to install and start CDAP. Note that the screens of the wizard will vary depending on
which version of Cloudera Manager and CDAP you are using.

.. _cloudera-add-a-service:

Add CDAP Service
----------------
Start from the Cloudera Manager Admin Console's *Home* page, selecting *Add Service* from the menu for your cluster:

Add Service Wizard: Reviewing Configuration
-------------------------------------------

**App Artifact Dir:** This should initially point to the bundled system artifacts included
in the CDAP parcel directory. If you have modified ``${PARCELS_ROOT}`` for your instance
of Cloudera Manager, please update this setting (*App Artifact Dir*) to match. You may
want to customize this directory to a location outside of the CDAP Parcel.

**Explore Enabled:** This needs to be disabled if you **didn't** select Hive earlier.

**Kerberos Auth Enabled:** This is needed if running on a secure Hadoop cluster.

**Router Bind Port, Router Server Port:** These two ports should match; *Router Server
Port* is used by the CDAP UI to connect to the CDAP Router service.

   **Add Service Wizard, Page 4:** Reviewing changes and (initial) configuration.

**Additional CDAP configuration properties** can be added using Cloudera Manager's *Safety
Valve Advanced Configuration Snippets.* Documentation of the available CDAP properties is
in the :ref:`appendix-cdap-site.xml`. Note that for certain CDAP properties, the defaults
values for Cloudera may vary from the above appendix:

- For ``kafka.server.log.dirs``, the default value is ``{$LOCAL_DIR/kafka-logs}`` or
  ``/var/tmp/cdap/kafka-logs``, instead of ``/tmp/kafka-logs`` as shown in the
  :ref:`Appendix: Kafka Server <appendix-cdap-default-kafka-server>`.

**Additional environment variables** can be set, as required, using Cloudera Manager's
*CDAP Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve).* See the example below for
:ref:`configuring Spark <cloudera-configuring-spark>`.

Cluster Home Page: Configuring for Spark
----------------------------------------
**Including Spark:** If your cluster contains both Spark1 and Spark2, and you would like to use Spark2,
the *Environment Advanced Configuration* needs to contain the Spark version to use as
``SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION=2``. If you only have one version of Spark installed, CDAP will use that version.

**Additional environment variables** are set using the Cloudera Manager's
"CDAP Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)".

   **Cloudera Manager:** CDAP added to the cluster.

You can select it, and go to the *CDAP* page, with *Quick Links* and *Status Summary*. The
lights of the *Status Summary* should all turn green, showing completion of startup.
(**Note:** *Gateway* is not an actual service, and does not show a green status indicator.)

The *Quick Links* includes a link to the **CDAP UI**, which by default is running on
port ``11011`` of the host where the UI role instance is running.

    :start-after: .. _cloudera-configuration-eps:

.. _cloudera-configuration-enabling-kerberos:

Enabling Kerberos
-----------------
For Kerberos-enabled Hadoop clusters:

- The ``cdap`` user needs to be granted HBase permissions to create tables.
  As the ``hbase`` user, issue the command::

    $ echo "grant 'cdap', 'RWCA'" | hbase shell

- The ``cdap`` user must be able to launch YARN containers, either by adding it to the YARN
  ``allowed.system.users`` or by adjusting the YARN ``min.user.id`` to include the ``cdap`` user.
  (Search for the YARN configuration ``allowed.system.users`` in Cloudera Manager, and then add
  the ``cdap`` user to the whitelist.)

- If you are converting an existing CDAP cluster to being Kerberos-enabled, then you may
  run into YARN usercache directory permission problems. A non-Kerberos cluster with
  default settings will run CDAP containers as the user ``yarn``. A Kerberos cluster will
  run them as the user ``cdap``. When converting, the usercache directory that YARN
  creates will already exist and be owned by a different user. On all datanodes, run this
  command, substituting in the correct value of the YARN parameter ``yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs``::

    $ rm -rf <YARN.NODEMANAGER.LOCAL-DIRS>/usercache/cdap

  (As ``yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs`` can be a comma-separated list of directories, you may
  need to run this command multiple times, once for each entry.)

  If, for example, the setting for ``yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs`` is ``/yarn/nm``, you would use::

    $ rm -rf /yarn/nm/usercache/cdap

  Restart CDAP after removing the usercache(s).


.. _cloudera-configuration-integration-sentry:

Enabling Sentry
---------------
To use CDAP with Cloudera clusters using Sentry authorization, refer to the steps at
:ref:`Apache Sentry Configuration <apache-sentry-configuration>`

The properties described there can be set from within Cloudera Manager by searching for them in the
configuration for each component; particularly, Sentry and Hive.


.. _cloudera-configuration-highly-available:

Enabling CDAP HA
----------------
In addition to having a :ref:`cluster architecture <admin-manual-install-deployment-architectures-ha>`
that supports HA (high availability), these additional configuration steps need to be followed and completed:

CDAP Components
...............
For each of the CDAP components listed below (Master, Router, Kafka, UI, Authentication Server), these
comments apply:

- Sync the configuration files (such as ``cdap-site.xml`` and ``cdap-security.xml``) on all the nodes.
- While the default *bind.address* settings (``0.0.0.0``, used for ``app.bind.address``,
  ``data.tx.bind.address``, ``router.bind.address``, and so on) can be synced across hosts,
  if you customize them to a particular IP address, they will |---| as a result |---| be
  different on different hosts. This can be controlled by the settings for an individual *Role Instance*.

CDAP Master
...........
The CDAP Master service primarily performs coordination tasks and can be scaled for redundancy. The
instances coordinate amongst themselves, electing one as a leader at all times.

- Using the Cloudera Manager UI, add additional *Role Instances* of the role type ``CDAP Master
  Service`` to additional machines.
- Ensure each machine has all required Gateway roles.
- Start each ``CDAP Master Service`` role.

CDAP Router
...........
The CDAP Router service is a stateless API endpoint for CDAP, and simply routes requests to the
appropriate service. It can be scaled horizontally for performance. A load balancer, if
desired, can be placed in front of the nodes running the service.

- Using the Cloudera Manager UI, add *Role Instances* of the role type ``CDAP Gateway/Router
  Service`` to additional machines.
- Start each ``CDAP Gateway/Router Service`` role.

CDAP Kafka
..........
- Using the Cloudera Manager UI, add *Role Instances* of the role type ``CDAP Kafka Service``
  to additional machines.
- Two properties govern the Kafka setting in the cluster:

  - The **list of Kafka seed brokers** is generated automatically, but the
    replication factor (``kafka.default.replication.factor``) is not set
    automatically. Instead, it needs to be set manually.
  - The **replication factor** is used to replicate Kafka messages across
    multiple machines to prevent data loss in the event of a hardware
    failure.

- The recommended setting is to run **at least two** Kafka brokers with a **minimum replication
  factor of two**; set this property to the maximum number of tolerated machine failures
  plus one (assuming you have that number of machines). For example, if you were running
  five Kafka brokers, and would tolerate two of those failing, you would set the
  replication factor to three. The number of Kafka brokers listed should always be equal to
  or greater than the replication factor.
- Start each ``CDAP Kafka Service`` role.

CDAP UI
.......
- Using the Cloudera Manager UI, add *Role Instances* of the role type ``CDAP UI Service``
  to additional machines.
- For Cloudera Manager, the CDAP UI and the CDAP Router currently need to be colocated on
  the same node.
- Start each ``CDAP UI Service`` role.

CDAP Authentication Server
..........................
- Using the Cloudera Manager UI, add *Role Instances* of the role type ``CDAP Security Auth
  Service`` (the CDAP Authentication Server) to additional machines.
- Start each ``CDAP Security Auth Service`` role.
- Note that when an unauthenticated request is made in a secure HA setup, a list of all
  running authentication endpoints will be returned in the body of the request.

.. Enabling Hive Execution Engines
.. -------------------------------
.. _cloudera-configuration-enabling-hive-execution-engines:

.. include:: /_includes/installation/hive-execution-engines.txt

.. _cloudera-configuration-enabling-spark2:

Enabling Spark2
---------------
In order to use Spark2, you must first install Spark2 on your cluster. If both Spark1
and Spark2 are installed, you must set SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION to 2 in cdap-env.
When Spark2 is in use, Spark1 programs cannot be run. Similarly, when Spark1 is in use,
Spark2 programs cannot be run.
