CDAP Smoke Test
---------------
The CDAP UI may initially show errors while all of the CDAP YARN containers are
starting up. Allow for up to a few minutes for this. 

The *Administration* page of the CDAP UI shows the status of the CDAP services.
It can be reached at ``http://<cdap-host>:11011/cdap/administration``, substituting for
``<cdap-host>`` the host name or IP address of the CDAP server:
