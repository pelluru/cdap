Hadoop Configuration
--------------------
#. ZooKeeper's ``maxClientCnxns`` must be raised from its default.  We suggest setting it to zero
   (0: unlimited connections). As each YARN container launched by CDAP makes a connection to ZooKeeper, 
   the number of connections required is a function of usage.

#. Ensure that YARN has sufficient memory capacity by lowering the default minimum container 
   size (controlled by the property ``yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb``). Lack of
   YARN memory capacity is the leading cause of apparent failures that we see reported.
   We recommend starting with these settings:
   
   - ``yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec``: 43200 *(see note below)*
   - ``yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb``: 512 mb
   
   The value we recommend for ``yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec`` (``43200`` or 12
   hours) is what we use internally at Cask for testing as that provides adequate time to
   capture the logs of any failures. However, you should use an appropriate non-zero value
   specific to your environment. A large value can be expensive from a storage perspective.
   
   Please ensure your ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores`` and
   ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb`` settings are set sufficiently to run CDAP,
   as described in the :ref:`CDAP Memory and Core Requirements 
   <admin-manual-memory-core-requirements>`.
