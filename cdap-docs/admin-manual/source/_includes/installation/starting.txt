Starting CDAP Services
======================

.. highlight:: console

When all the packages and dependencies have been installed, and the configuration
parameters set, you can start the services on each of the CDAP boxes by running the
command::

  $ for i in `ls /etc/init.d/ | grep cdap` ; do sudo service $i start ; done

When all the services have completed starting, the CDAP UI should then be
accessible through a browser at port ``11011``. 

The URL will be ``http://<host>:11011`` where ``<host>`` is the IP address of
one of the machines where you installed the packages and started the services.

.. _|distribution|-starting-services-java-heapmax:

**Note:** Service-specific Java heap memory settings (that override the default values)
can be created by setting these environment variables::

  AUTH_JAVA_HEAPMAX
  KAFKA_JAVA_HEAPMAX
  MASTER_JAVA_HEAPMAX
  ROUTER_JAVA_HEAPMAX

.. end_of_list

such as::

  $ export AUTH_JAVA_HEAPMAX="-Xmx1024m"
  
Add any overriding settings to a file, usually ``/etc/cdap/conf/cdap-env.sh``. As
described above (in :ref:`|distribution|-configuration`), the location of this file will
depend on your particular configuration.
