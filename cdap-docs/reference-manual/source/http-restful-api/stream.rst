Stream HTTP RESTful API
=======================

.. highlight:: console

Use the CDAP Stream HTTP RESTful API to create a :ref:`stream <developer:streams>`; send,
read, and truncate events sent to and from a stream; and set the TTL property of a stream.

Streams may have multiple consumers (for example, multiple flows), each of which may be a
group of different agents (for example, multiple instances of a flowlet).

Additional details and examples are found in the :ref:`Developer Manual: Streams <developer:streams>`.

.. Base URL explanation

Creating a Stream
=================
A stream can be created with an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

  PUT /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<new-stream-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``new-stream-id``
     - Name of the stream to be created

.. rubric:: HTTP Responses
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event either successfully created a stream or the stream already exists
   * - ``403 FORBIDDEN``
     - The stream already exists with a different Kerberos principal

.. rubric:: Example
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT /v3/namespaces/default/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Create a new stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default*

.. rubric:: Comments

- The ``new-stream-id`` should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing stream remains in place.

Optionally, properties for the stream can be set by providing them in the body of the
request. These properties can later be
:ref:`retrieved <http-restful-api-stream-getting-properties>` or
:ref:`modified <http-restful-api-stream-setting-properties>` (with the exception of the ``principal``)
using :ref:`appropriate calls  <http-restful-api-stream-getting-setting-properties>`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``ttl``
     - ``Long.MAX`` (2^63 - 1)
     - Number of seconds that an event will be valid for, since it was ingested
   * - ``format``
     - ``text``
     - JSON Object describing the format name, schema, and settings. Accepted formats are
       ``avro``, ``csv`` (comma-separated), ``tsv`` (tab-separated), ``text``, ``clf``,
       ``grok``, and ``syslog``.
   * - ``notification.threshold.mb``
     - 1024
     - Increment of data, in MB, that a stream has to receive before
       publishing a notification.
   * - ``description``
     - ``null``
     - Description of the stream
   * - ``principal``
     - ``null``
     - Kerberos principal with which the stream should be created

If a property is not given in the request body, the default value will be used instead.
Once the stream has been created, the ``principal`` cannot be changed.

Sending Events to a Stream
==========================
An event can be sent to a stream by sending an HTTP POST method to the URL of the stream::

  POST /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>

In cases where it is acceptable to have some events lost, events can be transmitted
asynchronously to a stream with higher throughput by sending an HTTP POST method to the
``async`` URL::

  POST /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>/async

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``stream-id``
     - Name of an existing stream

.. rubric:: HTTP Responses
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and persisted
   * - ``202 ACCEPTED``
     - The event was successfully received but may not be persisted; only the asynchronous endpoint will return this status code
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The stream does not exist


.. rubric:: Example
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST /v3/namespaces/default/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Send an event to the existing stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default*

.. rubric:: Comments

You can pass headers for the event as HTTP headers by prefixing them with the *stream-id*::

  <stream-id>.<property>:<string-value>

After receiving the request, the HTTP handler transforms it into a stream event:

- The body of the event is an identical copy of the bytes found in the body of the HTTP POST request.
- If the request contains any headers prefixed with the *stream-id*,
  the *stream-id* prefix is stripped from the header name and
  the header is added to the event.

Sending Events to a Stream in Batch
===================================
Multiple events can be sent to a stream in batch by sending an HTTP POST method to the URL of the stream::

  POST /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>/batch

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``stream-id``
     - Name of an existing stream

The ``Content-Type`` header must be specified to describe the data type in the POST body. Currently, these
types are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Content-Type
     - Description
   * - ``text/<sub-type>``
     - Text content with one line per event; the ``<sub-type>`` can be anything
   * - ``avro/binary``
     - Avro Object Container File format; each Avro record in the file becomes a single event in the stream

.. rubric:: HTTP Responses
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - All events were successfully received and persisted
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The stream does not exist

.. rubric:: Example
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST /v3/namespaces/default/streams/mystream/batch``
   * - Content-Type Header
     - ``Content-type: text/csv``
   * - POST Body
     - A comma-separated record per line::

        1,Sam,Smith,18
        2,Max,Johnson,28
        3,Bill,Jones,20

   * - Description
     - Writes three comma-separated events to the stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default*

.. rubric:: Comments

- If using commands such as ``curl``, the body must be passed with the option
  ``--data-binary`` in order for the lines to be correctly resolved into separate records.

- You can pass headers that apply to all events as HTTP headers by prefixing them with the
  *stream-id*::

    <stream-id>.<property>:<string-value>

  After receiving the request, if the request contains any headers prefixed with the
  *stream-id*, the *stream-id* prefix is stripped from the header name and the header is
  added to each event sent in the request body.


Reading Events from a Stream
============================
Reading events from an existing stream is performed with an HTTP GET method to the URL::

  GET /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>/events?start=<startTime>&end=<endTime>&limit=<limit>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``stream-id``
     - Name of an existing stream
   * - ``startTime``
     - Optional timestamp in milliseconds to start reading events from (inclusive); default is 0
   * - ``endTime``
     - Optional timestamp in milliseconds for the last event to read (exclusive); default is the maximum timestamp (2^63)
   * - ``limit``
     - Optional maximum number of events to read; default is unlimited

.. rubric:: HTTP Responses
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the result of the read was returned
   * - ``204 No Content``
     - The stream exists but there are no events that satisfy the request
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The stream does not exist

.. highlight:: json-ellipsis

The response body is a JSON array with the stream event objects as array elements::

   [
     {"timestamp" : ... , "headers": { ... }, "body" : ... },
     {"timestamp" : ... , "headers": { ... }, "body" : ... }
   ]

.. highlight:: console

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``timestamp``
     - Timestamp in milliseconds of the stream event at ingestion time
   * - ``headers``
     - A JSON map of all custom headers associated with the stream event
   * - ``body``
     - A printable string representing the event body; non-printable bytes are hex escaped in the format ``\x[hex-digit][hex-digit]``, e.g. ``\x05``

.. rubric:: Example
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET /v3/namespaces/default/streams/mystream/events?limit=1``
   * - Description
     - Read the initial event from an existing stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default*
   * - Response body
     - ``[ {"timestamp" : 1407806944181, "headers" : { }, "body" : "Hello World" } ]``

Truncating a Stream
===================
Truncating means deleting all events that were ever written to the stream.
This is permanent and cannot be undone.
A stream can be truncated with an HTTP POST method to the URL::

  POST /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>/truncate

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``stream-id``
     - Name of an existing stream

.. rubric:: HTTP Responses
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The stream was successfully truncated
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The stream ``{stream-id}`` does not exist

.. rubric:: Example
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST /v3/namespaces/default/streams/mystream/truncate``
   * - Description
     - Delete all events in the stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default*

Deleting a Stream
=================
Deleting a stream means both deleting all events that were ever written to the stream and
the stream endpoint itself. This is permanent and cannot be undone. If another stream is
created with the same name, it will not return any of the previous stream's events.

A stream can be deleted with an HTTP DELETE method to the URL::

  DELETE /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/streams/<stream-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``stream-id``
     - Name of an existing stream

     - Deletes the stream named *mystream* in the namespace *default* and all events in
       the stream

.. _http-restful-api-stream-getting-setting-properties:

Getting and Setting Stream Properties
=====================================
There are a number of stream properties that can be retrieved and specified:

- The **Time-To-Live** (TTL, specified in seconds) property governs how long an event is
  valid for consumption since it was written to the stream. The default TTL for all streams
  is infinite, meaning that events will never expire.

- The **format** property defines how stream event bodies should be read for data
  exploration. Different formats support different types of schemas. Schemas are used to
  determine the table schema used for running ad-hoc SQL-like queries on the stream. See
  :ref:`stream-exploration` for more information about formats and schemas.

- The **notification threshold** defines the increment of data that a stream has to
  receive before publishing a notification.

- The **description** of the stream.

- The **principal** of the stream (which, if set, is unmodifiable).

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``ttl``
     - Number of seconds that an event will be valid for, since it was ingested
   * - ``format``
     - JSON Object describing the format name, schema, and settings. Accepted formats are
       ``avro``, ``csv`` (comma-separated), ``tsv`` (tab-separated), ``text``, ``clf``,
       ``grok``, and ``syslog``.

     - Description of the stream
   * - ``principal``
     - The Kerberos principal of a stream cannot be updated. This should be the same as
       the existing principal or absent.

If a property is not given in the request body, no change will be made to the value.
For example, setting format but not TTL will preserve the current value for TTL.
Changing the schema attached to a stream will drop the Hive table associated with
the stream and re-create it with the new schema.
