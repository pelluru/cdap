Monitor HTTP RESTful API
========================

.. highlight:: console

Use the CDAP Monitor HTTP RESTful API to examine the CDAP system services used internally by CDAP.
Additional details on monitoring can be found in the :ref:`Administration Manual: Logging
and Monitoring <logging-monitoring>`.

.. Base URL explanation
.. --------------------
.. include:: base-url.txt


Listing all System Services and their Details
=============================================

For the detailed information of all available CDAP system services, use::

  GET /v3/system/services

.. highlight:: json-ellipsis

The response body will contain a JSON-formatted list of the existing system services::

  [
      {
          "name": "appfabric",
          "description": "Service for managing application lifecycle.",
          "status": "OK",
          "logs": "OK",
          "min": 1,
          "max": 1,
          "requested": 1,
          "provisioned": 1
      }

Scaling System Services
=======================
In distributed CDAP installations, the number of instances for CDAP system services
can be queried and changed by using these commands::

  GET /v3/system/services/<service-id>/instances
  PUT /v3/system/services/<service-id>/instances

.. highlight:: json

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

        { "instances" : <quantity> }

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``service-id``
     - Name (ID) of the system service
   * - ``quantity``
     - Number of instances to be used

**Note:** In the CDAP Sandbox, trying to set the instances of system services will return a Status Code ``400 Bad Request``.

.. rubric:: Examples
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET /v3/system/services/metrics/instances``
