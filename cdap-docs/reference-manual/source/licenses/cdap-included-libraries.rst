  ANTLR 2 License

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual
  or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code
  generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical
  software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given
  to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any
  source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise)
  that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If
  you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you
  developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source
  code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system
  and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

  In countries where the Public Domain status of the work may not be valid, the author
  grants a copyright licence to the general public to deal in the work without restriction
  and permission to sublicence derivates under the terms of any (OSI approved) Open Source
  licence.

  The Python parser generator code under antlr/actions/python/ is covered by the 3-clause
  BSD licence (this part is included in the binary JAR files); the run-time part under
  lib/python/ is covered by the GNU GPL, version 3 or later (this part is not included in
  the binary JAR files). See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=750643#80"
