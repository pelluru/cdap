.. rubric:: Introduction

One of the first tasks of actually working with Big Data applications is getting the data in.
As data ingestion is a fundamental issue, and as one tool often does not fit all needs,
we have assembled tools and applications to assist with ingesting data into CDAP:

- Java, Python, and Ruby APIs for controlling and writing to streams; and
- an Apache Flume Sink implementation for writing events received from a source.
