Workers
=======

*Workers* can be used to run background processes. *Workers* provide the ability to write data processing logic
that doesn't fit into the other paradigms such as flows and MapReduce or real-time and batch processing.

You can add workers to your application by calling the ``addWorker`` method in the application's
``configure`` method::

  public class AnalyticsApp extends AbstractApplication {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("AnalyticsApp");
      ...
      addWorker(new ProcessWorker());
      ...
    }
  }

Workers have semantics similar to a Java thread and are run in a thread when CDAP is run in either in-memory
or local sandbox modes. In distributed mode, each instance of a worker runs in its own YARN container.
Their instances may be updated via the :ref:`Command Line Interface <cli-available-commands>` or
a :ref:`RESTful API <http-restful-api-lifecycle>`::

  public class ProcessWorker extends AbstractWorker {

    @Override
    public void initialize(WorkerContext context) {
      super.initialize(context);
      ...
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
      ...
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
      ...
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
      ...
    }
  }

Workers and Resources
=====================

The size of the YARN container and the number of virtual cores allocated to a worker can
be specified using a ``setResources`` method in the worker ``initialize`` method::

    @Override
    public void initialize(WorkerContext context) {
      super.initialize(context);
      ...
      setResources(new Resources(1024, 2));
      ...
    }

In this example, each worker container will be initialized with 1024 MB of memory and 2
virtual cores.

.. _workers-datasets:

Workers and Datasets
====================

Workers can access and use datasets via a ``DatasetContext`` inside the ``run`` method of a ``TxRunnable``.
A ``TxRunnable`` can be executed using the ``execute`` method of a ``WorkerContext``. Note that ``WorkerContext``
is thread-safe and that each thread will receive its own instance of the ``Dataset`` being accessed. Though it is
necessary to use the ``getDataset`` method of ``DatasetContext`` to access a ``Dataset`` instance inside a
``TxRunnable``, this operation is performance-optimized with the help of internal caching logic. In this
example, the dataset *tableName* is accessed from within a ``TxRunnable``::

  @Override
  public void run() {
    getContext().execute(new TxRunnable() {
      @Override
      public void run(DatasetContext context) {
        Dataset dataset = context.getDataset("tableName");
        ...
      }
    });
  }

Operations executed on datasets within a ``run`` are committed as part of a single transaction.
The transaction is started before ``run`` is invoked and is committed upon successful execution. Exceptions
thrown while committing the transaction or thrown by user-code result in a rollback of the transaction.
It is recommended that ``TransactionConflictException`` be caught and handled appropriately; for example,
you can retry a ``dataset`` operation.

Services can be discovered from inside of workers. Services can either belong to the same application or to another
application in the same namespace. ``WorkerContext`` can be used to discover the URL of the service of interest::

  @Override
  public void run() {
    URL url = getContext().getServiceURL("myService");

    // To discover a service in another application in the same namespace, use:
    url = getContext().getServiceURL("anotherAppName", "anotherServiceId");
  }


Writing to Streams
==================

Workers have the ability to write to streams through the ``WorkerContext``. The implementation internally
issues an HTTP request to the stream service to persist the data. Because of that, a write to a stream
cannot be rolled back, and thus the write differs in semantics compared to writing to datasets from inside the
``run`` method of a ``TxRunnable``.

The write operation throws an ``IOException`` if it could not write to a stream. Writing to streams can be
performed as either single event writes or in batch.

When uploading events in batch, there are two options: either uploading a ``File`` or writing multiple events
through a ``StreamBatchWriter``. In batch mode, the content type of the data must be specified. Refer
to the :ref:`Stream RESTful API <http-restful-api-stream>` for information on the content type specification.

With a ``StreamBatchWriter``, the ``close`` method needs to be called after all the writes have been performed::

  @Override
  public void run() {
    try {
      // Writing a single string event to stream myStream
      getContext().write("myStream", "data1");

      Map<String, String> header = Maps.newHashMap();
      header.put("k1", "v1");

      // Writing a single string event with header to stream myStream
      getContext().write("myStream", "data2", header);

      // Writing a set of events as one batch operation to stream myStream (with content type as text)
      StreamBatchWriter batchWriter = getContext().createBatchWriter("myStream", "text/string");
      batchWriter.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(Bytes.toBytes("data1\n")));
      batchWriter.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(Bytes.toBytes("data2\n")));
      batchWriter.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(Bytes.toBytes("data3")));
      batchWriter.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
      // Handle exception
    }
  }
