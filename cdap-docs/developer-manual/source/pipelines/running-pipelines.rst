Running Pipelines
=================

Pipeline can be started, stopped, and controlled using:

- :ref:`CDAP Pipelines UI <cdap-pipelines-running-pipelines-within-cdap-pipelines-ui>`
- :ref:`CDAP UI <cdap-ui>`
- :ref:`CDAP CLI <cdap-cli>`
- Command line tools, using the :ref:`Lifecycle HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-lifecycle-start>`


.. _cdap-pipelines-running-pipelines-within-cdap-pipelines-ui:

Running a Pipeline within the CDAP Pipelines UI
===============================================
From within the CDAP Pipelines UI, you can start and stop pipelines. 

For a **batch pipeline,** you can start or stop ("suspend") its schedule. It will then begin
at the next scheduled time. (To change the schedule requires creating a new pipeline with
a new schedule.)

For a **real-time pipeline,** you simply start or stop the pipeline.

You can set the arguments used to start the pipeline (both as preferences and runtime
arguments) and view details of a pipeline, such as its configuration, settings, stages,
schemas, and logs.


Runtime Arguments
=================
You may want to create a pipeline that has several configuration settings that are not
known at pipeline creation time, but that are set at the start of the each pipeline run.

For instance, you might want a pipeline that reads from a database (a source) and writes
to a table (a sink). The name of the database source and name of the table sink might
change from run to run and you need to specify those values as input before starting a
run.

You might want to create a pipeline with a particular action at the start of the run.
The action could, based on some logic, provide the name of the database to use as a source
and the name of the table to write as a sink. The next stage in the pipeline might use
this information to read and write from appropriate sources and sinks.

To do this, CDAP supports the use of macros that will, at runtime, will be evaluated
and substituted for. The macros support recursive (nested) expansion and use a simple
syntax. These macros are :ref:`defined in the pipeline configuration  
<cdap-pipelines-runtime-arguments-macros>` and in the runtime arguments.

Runtime arguments are resolved by sourcing them from the application preferences, the
runtime arguments, and the workflow token. Precedence is with the workflow token having
the highest precedence.

These arguments and preferences can be set with the CDAP UI, the CDAP CLI or the 
:ref:`Program Lifecycle <http-restful-api-program-lifecycle>` and :ref:`Preferences
<http-restful-api-preferences>` HTTP RESTful APIs.

Details of usage and examples are explained in the section on :ref:`runtime arguments and
macros <cdap-pipelines-runtime-arguments-macros>`.


Re-running a Pipeline
=====================
When a pipeline is re-run, any previously-set runtime arguments will have been discarded
and will need to be set again, if required. Any previously-set application preferences will
be retained and re-used.


Notifications
=============
When a pipeline is completed, notifications can be sent by using one or more *post-run
actions*. These are :ref:`set in the pipeline configuration 
<cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-post-run-actions>`.

These :ref:`post-run plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-post-run-plugins>` allow for emails,
database queries, and a general HTTP callback action.


Logs
====
As pipelines run, they create entries in the CDAP logs.

Logs for a pipeline can be obtained using the same tools as any other CDAP application and
program, and are described in the :ref:`Administration manual, Logging and Monitoring
<logging-monitoring>` and the :ref:`Logging HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-logging>`.

Script transform steps can write to logs, as described in the section in developing
plugins on :ref:`script transformations
<cdap-pipelines-creating-a-plugin-script-transformations>`.


Metrics
=======
As pipelines run, they create both system and user metrics.

System metrics for a pipeline can be obtained using the same tools as any other CDAP
application and program, and are described in the :ref:`Administration manual, metrics
<operations-metrics>` and the :ref:`Metrics HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-metrics>`.

Script transform steps can create metrics, as described in the section in developing
plugins on :ref:`script transformations
<cdap-pipelines-creating-a-plugin-script-transformations>`.

For instance, if you have a real-time pipeline named "demoPipeline" with three stages
(*DataGenerator*, *JavaScript*, and *Table*), then you can discover the available metrics
using a `curl` command, such as (reformatted for display):

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X POST "http://localhost:11015/v3/metrics/search?target=metric&tag=namespace:default&tag=app:demoPipeline"

    ["system.app.log.debug","system.app.log.info","system.app.log.warn","system.dataset.
    store.bytes","system.dataset.store.ops","system.dataset.store.reads","system.dataset.
    store.writes","system.metrics.emitted.count","user.DataGenerator.records.out","user.
    JavaScript.record.count","user.JavaScript.records.in","user.JavaScript.records.out","
    user.Table.records.in","user.Table.records.out","user.metrics.emitted.count"]
  
In this case, the user metric *"user.JavaScript.record.count"* was incremented in the JavaScript stage using::

  context.getMetrics().count('record.count', 1);
  
The value of the metric can be retrieved with:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ curl -w"\n" -X POST "localhost:11015/v3/metrics/query?tag=namespace:default&tag=app:etlRealtime6&metric=user.JavaScript.record.count&aggregate=true"

    {"startTime":0,"endTime":1468884338,"series":[{"metricName":"user.JavaScript.record.
    count","grouping":{},"data":[{"time":0,"value":170}]}],"resolution":"2147483647s"}

Using the CDAP CLI, you can retrieve the value with:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::
    :tabs: "CDAP CLI"
 
    |cdap >| get metric value user.JavaScript.record.count 'app=demoPipeline'
 
    Start time: 0
    End time: 1468884640
 
    Series: user.JavaScript.record.count
    +===================+
    | timestamp | value |
    +===================+
    | 0         | 170   |
    +===================+

.. _cdap-pipelines-running-pipelines-error-record-handling:

Error Record Handling
=====================
To handle the problem of validating records and handling any subsequent errors, certain
transform stages are available that can check that a record matches specified criteria.
Records that fail the criteria can be discarded, and appropriate messages written to a
configurable error dataset.

These transform plugins support error record handling:

- `JavaScript <plugins/transforms/javascript-transform.html>`__
- `Python Evaluator <plugins/transforms/pythonevaluator-transform.html>`__
- `Validator <plugins/transforms/validator-transform.html>`__
- `XML Parser <plugins/transforms/xmlparser-transform.html>`__

See the :ref:`Core Validator <cdap-pipelines-plugins-shared-core-validator>` for examples
and additional information.


Configuring Resources
=====================
Resources for pipelines can be configured as any other CDAP workflow application.

See the Administration Manual sections on :ref:`Scaling Instances <admin:scaling-instances>` and 
:ref:`Resource Guarantees for CDAP Programs in YARN <admin:resource-guarantees>`.


.. _cdap-pipelines-operating-upgrading-pipeline:

Upgrading a Pipeline
====================
If you wish to upgrade |previous-short-version|\.x pipelines, you can use the ETL upgrade
tool packaged with the **distributed** version of CDAP. You would want to run this tool to
upgrade applications that were created with earlier versions of the artifacts, that you
would like to open in the |version| version of CDAP Studio.

The tool will connect to an instance of CDAP, look for any applications that use
|previous-short-version|\.x versions of the system artifacts, and then update the
application to use the |version| version of those artifacts.

CDAP must be running when you run the command:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    |$| java -cp /opt/cdap/master/libexec/cdap-etl-tools-|version|.jar co.cask.cdap.etl.tool.UpgradeTool -u \http://<host>:<port> -e /tmp/failedUpgrades upgrade

The first argument is the host and port for the :ref:`CDAP router
<appendix-cdap-default-router>`. The second argument is a directory to write the
configurations of any pipelines that could not be upgraded. A pipeline may fail to upgrade
if the new version of a plugin used in the pipeline is not backwards compatible. For
example, this may happen if the plugin added a new required property.

You can also upgrade just the ETL applications within a specific namespace:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    |$| java -cp /opt/cdap/master/libexec/cdap-etl-tools-|version|.jar co.cask.cdap.etl.tool.UpgradeTool -u \http://<host>:<port> -n <namespace-id> upgrade

You can also upgrade just one ETL application:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    |$| java -cp /opt/cdap/master/libexec/cdap-etl-tools-|version|.jar co.cask.cdap.etl.tool.UpgradeTool -u \http://<host>:<port> -n <namespace-id> -p <app-name> upgrade

If you have authentication turned on, you also need to store an access token in a file and pass the file to the tool:

.. container:: highlight

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    |$| java -cp /opt/cdap/master/libexec/cdap-etl-tools-|version|.jar co.cask.cdap.etl.tool.UpgradeTool -u \http://<host>:<port> -a <tokenfile> upgrade

For instance, if you have obtained an access token (as shown in the example in the
`security documentation <testing-security>`) such as::

    {"access_token":"AghjZGFwAI7e8p65Uo7OpfG5UrD87psGQE0u0sFDoqxtacdRR5GxEb6bkTypP7mXdqvqqnLmfxOS",
      "token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":86400}

The access token itself (``AghjZGFwAI7e8p65Uo7OpfG5UrD87psGQE0u0sFDoqxtacdRR5GxEb6bkTypP7mXdqvqqnLmfxOS``) 
would be placed in a file and then the file's path would be used in the above command.
