==================
Creating Pipelines
==================

Pipelines are created from *artifacts*. A number of artifacts are supplied with CDAP, and
custom artifacts can be created by developers. An artifact is a blueprint or template that
|---| with the addition of a configuration file |---| is used to create an application.

A pipeline application is created by preparing a configuration that specifies the artifact
and which source, transformations (also known as transforms), and sinks are to be used to
create the application.

The sources, transformations, and sinks are packaged as extensions to CDAP known as
**plugins**, and can include actions to be taken at the start of pipeline run, at the end
of the run, and after the run has been completed. The plugins can be either those that are
packaged as part of CDAP or ones that have been installed separately.

The configuration can either be written as a JSON file or, in the case of the CDAP Studio,
specified in-memory.

CDAP currently provides two artifacts (referred to as *system artifacts*):

- ``cdap-data-pipeline`` (for batch pipelines)
- ``cdap-data-streams`` (for real-time pipelines)

which are used to create the different kinds of data pipeline applications.

**Note:** *Two system artifacts,* ``cdap-etl-batch`` *and* ``cdap-etl-realtime``, *have
been deprecated and replaced by the above artifacts, as of CDAP 3.5.0.*

Pipelines can be created using CDAP's included visual editor (the *CDAP Studio*), using
command-line tools such the CDAP CLI and ``curl``, or programmatically with scripts or
Java programs.


Methods for Creating Pipelines
==============================
There are two different methods for creating pipelines:

1. Using the *CDAP Studio*
#. Using command line tools (such as ``curl``, the CDAP CLI, or the CDAP UI)

Using the **CDAP Studio**, the basic operations are:

  1. **Create** a new pipeline, either by starting from a :ref:`blank canvas 
     <cdap-pipelines-getting-started-cdap-studio>`, starting from a
     :ref:`template <cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-pipeline-templates>`, or by 
     :ref:`cloning <cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-cloning>` an already-published pipeline.

  #. **Edit** the pipeline in the CDAP Studio, setting appropriate configurations and
     settings.

  #. **Save** the pipeline as you are working on it, as a draft pipeline, using a unique name.

  #. **Validate** the pipeline from within the CDAP Studio, to check that basic settings and
     naming are correct.

  #. **Publish** the pipeline from within the CDAP Studio, which will translate the virtual
     pipeline of the configuration into a physical pipeline with the specified name.
  
  At this point, the pipeline can be run.

  **Note:** Unlike many editors, the CDAP Studio does not allow draft pipelines to be
  published "on top of" existing, published pipelines, as this would invalidate existing
  logs, metrics, and datasets. Instead, it requires you to create a new name for any
  newly-published pipelines.

Using **command line tools,** the basic operations are:

  1. **Create** a new pipeline by writing a configuration file, in JSON format following the
     :ref:`CDAP Pipeline configuration specification 
     <cdap-pipelines-developing-pipelines-configuration-file-format>`, 
     either from an empty configuration, starting with an example or template, or re-using an
     existing configuration file.

  #. **Edit** the JSON configuration file in an editor, setting appropriate configurations and
     settings.

  #. **Publish** the pipeline either by using the Lifecycle RESTful API or CDAP CLI, which
     will translate the virtual pipeline of the configuration file into a physical pipeline
     with the specified name.
   
  Pipelines published using command line tools are visible within the CDAP UI, and
  can be cloned and edited using the CDAP Studio.


Batch Pipelines
===============

Introduction
------------
Batch pipelines can be scheduled to run periodically using a cron expression, and can read
data from batch sources using either a MapReduce or Spark job. The batch application then
performs any (optional) transformations before writing to one or more batch sinks.

Action plugins can be added to perform special actions before the pipeline starts, and
when it successfully finishes. Post-run actions can be specified that will always run,
irregardless if the pipeline successfully completed.

Types of Plugins
----------------
Batch pipelines, based on the ``cdap-data-pipeline`` application template, can include these plugins:

- :ref:`Actions <cdap-pipelines-plugins-actions>`

- :ref:`Batch Source Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sources>`

- :ref:`Transformation Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-transformations>`

- :ref:`Analytics Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-analytics>`

- :ref:`Batch Sink Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sinks>`

How Does It Work?
-----------------
The batch pipeline is created by taking a "virtual" pipeline (in the form of a
configuration file) and then creating a "physical" pipeline as a CDAP application with
appropriate CDAP programs to implement the configuration.

The programs used will depend on the engine chosen (MapReduce or Spark) and the plugins
used to build the pipeline. The available plugins are determined by those plugins that will
work with the *Data Pipeline* (the ``cdap-data-pipeline`` artifact), as listed above.

Building a Pipeline
-------------------
To create a batch pipeline, you can use either command line tools or the CDAP Studio.

To use the CDAP Studio to create a batch pipeline:

- Specify *Data Pipeline* (the ``cdap-data-pipeline`` artifact) as the application
  template for your pipeline.

- Click the icons in the left-sidebar to select the plugins you would like included in
  your pipeline. In addition to the :ref:`action plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-actions>`,
  the :ref:`transform plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-transformations>`, and certain of
  the :ref:`analytics plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-analytics>`, you can use
  any of the :ref:`batch source plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sources>` or the
  :ref:`batch sink plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sinks>`.

- Typically, you will need at a minimum a source, a sink, and any optional transformations or analytics
  that are required between the source and sink stages.
  
- Action steps can be added before a source and after a sink. These will be run only at
  the start (before a source) and only at the end if the pipeline successfully completes.

- The *Settings* button allows you to specify the *Schedule*, "Post-run Actions* and *Engine* used
  for the pipeline.

- Specify a schedule for the batch pipeline, using either the *basic* or *advanced* specification.
  The schedule uses the underlying operating system's ``cron`` application.

- :ref:`Post-run actions <cdap-pipelines-plugins-post-run-plugins>` can be specified, and
  these will be run depending on the configuration; they can run even if the pipeline fails,
  as they can be specified to run on one of *completion*, *success*, or *failure*. You can
  have any number of post-run actions, and additional ones are added by clicking the *+*
  button.
  
- Specify an engine to use for the CDAP application. By default, *MapReduce* is used.

- Complete all required information for each stage, and any optional information that your
  particular use requires.

- Save the pipeline under a unique name

- Validate the pipeline, to check for errors.

- Publish the pipeline, which will turn the virtual pipeline of the configuration file
  into a physical pipeline of CDAP programs in a CDAP application.
  
Note that publishing a pipeline can reveal errors that the validation step doesn't catch, as
validation is not an exhaustive test.

At this point you can run your pipeline.

Details and an example of using command line tools to create a batch pipeline are in the
section on :ref:`developing pipelines: creating a batch pipeline
<cdap-pipelines-developing-pipelines-creating-batch>`.

Scheduling
----------
From with the CDAP Studio, you can set a schedule for a batch pipeline that
will be used to run it. Note that as a schedule is set as part of the pipeline
configuration, a physical pipeline's schedule cannot be altered except by creating a new
pipeline with a new schedule.

Two interfaces are available: 

- A *basic* interface, where you select the time increment (every minute, hour, day, week,
  month, year) and the amount after the increment, as appropriate:

  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Hour  | Five-minute increment after the hour, 0 through 55 minutes                                                            |
  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Day   | Hour (twenty-four hour clock), plus five-minute increment after the hour, 0 through 55 minutes                        |
  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Week  | Day of the week, plus hour (twenty-four hour clock), plus five-minute increment after the hour, 0 through 55 minutes  |
  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Month | Day of the month, plus hour (twenty-four hour clock), plus five-minute increment after the hour, 0 through 55 minutes |
  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Year  | Date, plus hour (twenty-four hour clock), plus five-minute increment after the hour, 0 through 55 minutes             |
  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  If the specified time does not exist (for instance, you specified the 31st day of the
  month, which doesn't occur in June), the event is skipped until the next occurring event.
  
  This *basic* schedule is converted into a ``cron`` expression for the configuration file.

- An *advanced* interface, which provides you access to the same interface as used in the
  underlying ``cron`` program. The details of that program will depend on the operating
  system used by the host of the CDAP Master process.

Engine
------
You can specify the engine being used for a batch pipeline, either "MapReduce" (``mapreduce``)
or "Spark" (``spark``).

You set this either by selecting your choice using the *Settings* tool of the CDAP Studio,
or by setting the engine property in the configuration file for the pipeline::

    "engine": "mapreduce",

This determines the particular engine that will be used when the physical pipeline is
created.

.. _cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-actions:

Actions
-------
Actions can be configured for a batch pipeline, either by using the CDAP Studio or by
including a stage of type ``action`` in the configuration JSON file. The available actions
are determined by those available to the application template being used to create the
pipeline.

If configured, the action takes place either at the start or at the completion of a
pipeline run. All actions configured for the start will complete first before any other
stages, and all other stages will complete before any of the actions at the end are run.

Actions at the end will only run if the pipeline successfully completes. If you need an
action to run irregardless of completion, use a :ref:`post-run action
<cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-post-run-actions>` instead.

Currently, action plugins are only available when using the ``cdap-data-pipeline``
application template. Available action plugins are documented in the :ref:`Plugin
Reference <cdap-pipelines-plugins-actions>`, with this action available:

- *SSH Action*, which establishes an SSH connection with a remote machine to execute a
  command on that machine.

.. _cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-post-run-actions:

Post-run Actions
----------------
Post-run actions can be configured for a batch pipeline, either by using the CDAP Studio or
by setting the "postActions" property of the configuration JSON file. The available
actions are determined by the post-run plugins that are available to the application
template being used to create the pipeline.

If configured, the actions take place after the completion of a pipeline run,
and can happen depending of the status of the run. One of three conditions must be specified:

- completion (action takes place regardless of the status)
- success (action takes place only upon success)
- failure (action takes place only upon failure)

Currently, post-run plugins are only available when using the ``cdap-data-pipeline``
application template. Available post-run plugins are documented in the :ref:`Plugin Reference
<cdap-pipelines-plugins-post-run-plugins>`, with these actions currently available:

- sending an email
- running a database query
- making an HTTP request


Real-time Pipelines
===================

Introduction
------------
Real-time pipelines are designed to generate micro batches of data at a regular interval, perform any
(optional) transformations and analytics, and then write to one or more sinks. As they are
intended to be run continuously, actions and post-run actions are not applicable or available.
Real-time pipelines do not operate on a record by record basis, but on a micro batch by micro batch basis.

Types of Plugins
----------------
Real-time pipelines, based on the ``cdap-data-streams`` application template, can include these plugins:

- :ref:`Streaming Source Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-real-time-sources>`

- :ref:`Transformation Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-transformations>`

- :ref:`Analytics Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-analytics>`

- :ref:`Batch Sink Plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sinks>`

Despite the name, batch sink plugins are not limited to just batch pipelines.
The real-time pipeline artifact generates micro batches that can then be written to a batch sink.


How Does It Work?
-----------------
A real-time pipeline is created by taking a "virtual" pipeline (in the form of a
configuration file) and then creating a "physical" pipeline as a CDAP application with
appropriate CDAP programs to implement the configuration.

The application created will consist of a Spark Streaming program.

Building a Pipeline
-------------------
To create a real-time pipeline, you can use either the CDAP Studio or command line tools.

To use the CDAP Studio to create a real-time pipeline:

- Specify *Data Pipeline - Realtime* (the ``cdap-data-streams`` artifact) as the application
  template for your pipeline.

- Click the icons in the left-sidebar to select the plugins you would like included in
  your pipeline. In addition to the :ref:`transform plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-transformations>`
  and certain of the :ref:`analytics plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-analytics>`,
  you can use any of the :ref:`streaming source plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-real-time-sources>` or the
  :ref:`batch sink plugins <cdap-pipelines-plugins-batch-sinks>`.

- You will need at a minimum a source, a sink, and any optional transformations or analytics
  that are needed between the source and sink stages.
  
- The *Settings* button allows you to specify the batch interval for your pipeline. The batch interval controls
  how often your sources will generate a micro batch of data. This must be a number followed
  by a time unit, with 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, and 'h' for hours.
  For example, '10s' translates to ten seconds. This means the sources will generate a micro batch of data every
  ten seconds.

- Complete all required information for each stage, and any optional information that your
  particular use requires.

- Save the pipeline under a unique name

- Validate the pipeline, to check for errors.

- Publish the pipeline, which will turn the virtual pipeline of the configuration file
  into a physical pipeline of CDAP programs in a CDAP application.
  
Note that publishing a pipeline can reveal errors that the validation step doesn't catch, as
validation is not an exhaustive test.

At this point you can run your pipeline.

Details and an example of using command line tools to create a real-time pipeline are in the
section on :ref:`developing pipelines: creating a real-time pipeline
<cdap-pipelines-developing-pipelines-creating-real-time>`.


Field Configuration Settings
============================
These settings can be used in both batch and real-time pipelines.

Required Fields
---------------
Certain fields are required to be configured in order for the plugin to work. These are
identified in the CDAP Studio configuration panel by a red dot, and are described in
the :ref:`CDAP Pipelines Plugin Reference <cdap-pipelines-plugins>` documentation as *required*.

.. Configuring Resources
.. ---------------------

.. _cdap-pipelines-runtime-arguments-macros:

Field Macro Substitution
========================
Plugins can support macro-substitutable properties that allow placeholders for properties
that are unknown at configure time but are known and provided at runtime.

There are two types of macros supported in CDAP:

- :ref:`Property Lookups <cdap-pipelines-macros-property-lookups>`
- :ref:`Macro Functions <cdap-pipelines-macros-macro-functions>`

Fields that are macro-enabled are identified in the CDAP Studio UI and documented in
the :ref:`CDAP Pipelines Plugin Reference <cdap-pipelines-plugins>`.

.. _cdap-pipelines-macros-property-lookups:

Property Lookups
----------------
**Property lookups** are specified using the syntax ``${macro-name}``, 
where ``macro-name`` is a key that is looked up in a hierarchy of sources.

The property lookup process for the key ``${user-name}`` follows these steps:

#. lookup in the *workflow token* for the key ``user-name``, return value if found; else
#. lookup in the *runtime arguments* for the key ``user-name``, return value if found; else
#. lookup in the *preference store* for the key ``user-name``, return value if found; else
#. throw a "macro not found" exception.
 
This order is used so that the most volatile source (the workflow token) takes precedence.

For instance, you might not know the name of a source stream until runtime. You could use
in the source stream's *Stream Name* configuration::

  ${stream-name}
  
and in the runtime arguments set a key-value pair such as::

  stream-name: myDemoStream

In the CDAP Pipelines UI, macro property look-ups are determined from the configuration and are set as runtime arguments.
After providing values for these arguments, the CDAP pipeline can be started:

  .. figure:: _images/stream-table-macro-runtime.png
     :figwidth: 100%
     :width: 6in
     :align: center
     :class: bordered-image

*Notes:*

- Information on setting preferences and runtime arguments is in the :ref:`CDAP
  Administration Manual, Preferences <preferences>`. These can be set with the
  :ref:`Lifecycle <http-restful-api-lifecycle-start>` and :ref:`Preferences
  <http-restful-api-preferences>` HTTP RESTful APIs.

- To set values for macro keys through a CDAP pipeline's preferences, see the
  :ref:`Preferences HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-preferences>`.

.. _cdap-pipelines-macros-macro-functions:

Macro Functions
---------------
In addition to property lookups, you can use predefined **macro functions**. Currently,
these functions are predefined and available:

- ``logicalStartTime``
- ``secure``

.. |SimpleDateFormat| replace:: Java ``SimpleDateFormat``
.. _SimpleDateFormat: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html

Logical Start Time Function
...........................
The logicalStartTime macro function returns the logical start time of a run of the pipeline.

If no parameters are supplied, it returns the start time in milliseconds.
All parameters are optional. The function takes a time format, an offset, and a timezone as
arguments and uses the logical start time of a pipeline to perform the substitution::

  ${logicalStartTime([timeFormat[,offset [,timezone])}
  
where

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``timeFormat`` *(Optional)*
     - Time format string, in the format of a |SimpleDateFormat|
   * - ``offset`` *(Optional)*
     - Offset from the before the logical start time
   * - ``timezone`` *(Optional)*
     - Timezone to be used for the logical start time

For example, suppose the logical start time of a pipeline run is ``2016-01-01T00:00:00`` and
this macro is provided::

  ${logicalStartTime(yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH-mm-ss,1d-4h+30m)}

The format is ``yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH-mm-ss`` and the offset is ``1d-4h+30m`` before the logical
start time. This means the macro will be replaced with ``2015-12-31T03:30:00``, since the
offset translates to 20.5 hours. The entire macro evaluates to 20.5 hours before midnight
of January 1, 2016.

Secure Function
...............
The secure macro function takes in a single key as an argument and looks up the key's
associated string value from the Secure Store. In order to perform the substitution, the
key provided as an argument must already exist in the secure store. This is useful for
performing a substitution with sensitive data.

For example, for a plugin that connects to a MySQL database, you could configure the
*password* property field with::

  ${secure(password)}

which will pull the *password* from the Secure Store at runtime.

Recursive Macros
----------------
Macros can be referential (refer to other macros), up to ten levels deep. For instance,
you might have a server that refers to a hostname and port, and supply these runtime
arguments, one of which is a definition of a macro that uses other macros::

  hostname: my-demo-host.example.com
  port: 9991
  server-address: ${hostname}:${port}

In a pipeline configuration, you could use an expression such as::

  server-address: ${server-address}

expecting that it would be replaced with::

  my-demo-host.example.com:9991

Validation
==========
From within the CDAP Studio, the validation button will examine the pipeline
to check that basic settings and naming are correct. Messages of any errors found will be
shown in the Studio. Note that this step is not exhaustive, and errors may still be found
when the pipeline is actually published.


Publishing
==========
Publishing a pipeline takes a *virtual* pipeline (such as a draft in the CDAP Application
Studio, or a configuration JSON file) and creates a *physical* pipeline (a CDAP
application) using the configuration file, plugin artifacts, and application template
artifacts.

Publishing can happen either from with the CDAP Studio or by using command
line tools, such as the ``curl`` command with the Lifecycle RESTful API, or the CDAP CLI
tool with its ``create app`` command.

Using either method, published pipelines are visible within the CDAP UI, and
can be cloned and edited using the CDAP Studio.


Templates and Re-using Pipelines
================================
Existing pipelines can be used to create new pipelines by:

- Using a **pipeline template**
- **Cloning** an already-published pipeline and saving the resulting draft with a new name
- **Exporting** a configuration file, editing it, and then **importing** the revised file

.. _cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-pipeline-templates:

Pipeline Templates
------------------
A collection of predefined and preconfigured pipelines are available from within the CDAP Application
Studio through the controls at the top of the left side-bar. These templates can be used
as the starting point for either your own pipelines or your own pipeline templates.

.. figure:: _images/cdap-studio-annotated.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 6in
   :align: center
   :class: bordered-image

   **CDAP Studio:** Annotations showing components

First, select which application template you wish to use, either *Data Pipeline* or 
*ETL Real-time*.

Then, click *Template Gallery* to bring up a dialog that shows the available templates.
Click on the one you'd like to start with, and it will open, allowing you to begin customizing it
to your requirements.

.. These names & descriptions were extracted from cdap/cdap-ui/templates/apps/predefined/config.json

These are the available templates:

- **Data Pipeline**

  - **Model Trainer:** Train model using Naive Bayes classifier
  
  - **Event Classifier:** Classify events into spam or non-spam using a Naive Bayes model
  
  - **Log Data Aggregator:** Aggregate log data by grouping IP and HTTP Status

- **ETL Real-time**

  - **Kafka to HBase:** Ingests in real time from Kafka into an HBase table
  
  - **Kafka to Stream:** Ingests in real time from Kafka into a stream
  
  - **Kafka to OLAP Cube:** Generate an OLAP Cube in real time from Kafka
  
  - **Twitter to HBase:** Ingest real-time Twitter Stream into an HBase table
  
  - **Twitter to Stream:** Ingest real-time Twitter Stream into a stream
  
  - **Amazon SQS to HBase:** Real-time updates from Amazon Simple Queue Service into an HBase table
  
- **ETL Batch** (deprecated as of CDAP 3.5.0; use *Data Pipeline* instead)

  - **Stream to HBase:** Periodically ingest from a stream into an HBase table

.. _cdap-pipelines-creating-pipelines-cloning:

Cloning
-------
Any existing pipeline that has been published, can be *cloned.* This creates an in-memory
copy of the pipeline with the same name and opens it within the CDAP Studio.

At this point, you can rename the pipeline to a unique name and then either save it as a
:ref:`draft <cdap-studio-pipeline-drafts>` or publish it as a new pipeline. As
you cannot save over an existing pipeline, all new pipelines need a unique name; a common
practice is to increment the names, from *Demo-1* to *Demo-2* with each new clone. 

Exporting
---------
There are two ways you can export a pipeline configuration file:

1. From within the CDAP Studio; and
#. From within a CDAP pipeline configuration page.

1. From **within the CDAP Studio**, you can export a pipeline configuration JSON file using
   the *Export...* button:

   .. figure:: _images/cdap-pipelines-gs-1-5-buttons.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 6in
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **CDAP Studio:** Button labels, upper-right toolbar
    
   Clicking the "Export..." button will bring up the export dialog:
 
   .. figure:: _images/cdap-studio-export.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 6in
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **CDAP Studio:** Export dialog, with display of configuration file
    
   There are two similar actions you take. If you copy the text in the dialog and then
   paste it into a text editor, you will have a JSON file that is the configuration of the
   pipeline, but without the CDAP Studio UI information, such as the icon locations.

   If you use the "Export" button, it will prompt for a file location before saving a
   complete file with all the information required to recreate the pipeline in the CDAP Application
   Studio, including details such as icon location. Otherwise, the two exports are
   similar. The UI information is added in the ``"__ui__"`` object in the JSON configuration
   file.

#. From **within a CDAP pipeline configuration** page, there is an *Export* button:

   .. figure:: _images/cdap-pipelines-detail-configuration.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 6in
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **CDAP Pipelines:** Configuration page, pipeline detail, showing *Export* button on right
      
   Similar to exporting from with the CDAP Studio, exporting using the button will
   produce a configuration with UI information, and copying the configuration visible
   in the lower portion of the page will produce a configuration that does not include
   the ``"__ui__"`` object in the JSON.

Files created by exporting can be edited in a text editor and then imported to create new pipelines.

Importing
---------
From within the CDAP Studio, you can import a pipeline configuration JSON file to create a
new pipeline using the *Import Pipeline* button:

.. figure:: _images/cdap-pipelines-gs-1-5-buttons.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 6in
   :align: center
   :class: bordered-image

   **CDAP Studio:** Button labels, upper-right toolbar


As determined by the configuration file, the application template will be set
appropriately, and may change from the current one.

A valid configuration file that meets the :ref:`CDAP pipeline configuration file specification 
<cdap-pipelines-developing-pipelines-configuration-file-format>` is
required. It may be created from an existing pipeline by exporting its configuration file.
