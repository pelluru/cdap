===================
Application Logback
===================

YARN containers launched by a CDAP application use a default container logback file
|---| ``logback-container.xml`` |---| packaged with CDAP and installed in
the CDAP :ref:`configuration directory <admin-manual-cdap-components>`. This logback does
log rotation once every day at midnight and deletes logs older than 14 days. Depending on
the use case, the default configuration may be sufficient. As long as the container is
running, these policies will apply. (As the lifetime of many containers is often less than
14 days, these limits may never be reached.)

**Note:** In the case of the CDAP Sandbox, the logback file used is ``logback.xml``, located
in the ``<CDAP-HOME>/conf`` directory.

You can specify a custom ``logback.xml`` for a CDAP application by packaging
it with the application in the application's ``src/main/resources`` directory.
The packaged ``logback.xml`` is then used for each container launched by the application.

To write a custom ``logback.xml``, refer to the `Logback manual <http://logback.qos.ch/manual>`__
for information.

**Note:** When a custom ``logback.xml`` is specified for an application, the custom
``logback.xml`` will be used in place of the ``logback-container.xml``. A custom
``logback.xml`` needs to be configured for log rotation (``rollingPolicy``) and log
clean-up (``maxHistory``) to ensure that long-running containers don't fill up the disk.
