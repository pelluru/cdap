Custom Dataset Exploration
==========================


It is often useful to be able to explore a dataset in an ad-hoc manner.
This can be done using SQL if your dataset fulfills two requirements:

* it defines the schema for each record; and
* it has a method to scan its data record by record.

For CDAP datasets, this is done by implementing the ``RecordScannable`` interface.
The CDAP built-in ``KeyValueTable`` and ``ObjectMappedTable`` datasets already implement this
and can be used for ad-hoc queries.

Let's take a closer look at the ``RecordScannable`` interface.

Defining the Record Schema
--------------------------
The record schema is given by returning the Java type of each record, and CDAP will derive the record schema from
that type::

  Type getRecordType();

For example, suppose you have a class ``Entry`` defined as::

  class Entry {
    private final String key;
    private final int value;
    ...
  }

You can implement a record-scannable dataset that uses ``Entry`` as the record type::

  class MyDataset ... implements RecordScannable<Entry> {
    ...
    public Type getRecordType() {
      return Entry.class;
    }

Note that Java's ``Class`` implements ``Type`` and you can simply return ``Entry.class`` as the record type.
CDAP will use reflection to infer a SQL-style schema using the fields of the record type.

In the case of the above class ``Entry``, the schema will be::

  (key STRING, value INT)

.. _sql-limitations:

Limitations
-----------
* The record type must be a structured type, that is, a Java class with fields. This is because SQL tables require
  a structure type at the top level. This means the record type cannot be a primitive,
  collection or map type. However, these types may appear nested inside the record type.

* The record type must be that of an actual Java class, not an interface. The same applies to the types of any
  fields contained in the type. The reason is that interfaces only define methods but not fields; hence, reflection
  would not be able to derive any fields or types from the interface.

  The one exception to this rule is that Java collections such as ``List`` and ``Set`` are supported as well as
  Java ``Map``. This is possible because these interfaces are so commonly used that they deserve special handling.
  These interfaces are parameterized and require special care as described in the next section.

* The record type must not be recursive. In other words, it cannot contain any class that directly or indirectly
  contains a member of that same class. This is because a recursive type cannot be represented as a SQL schema.

* Fields of a class that are declared static or transient are ignored during schema generation. This means that the
  record type must have at least one non-transient and non-static field. For example,
  the ``java.util.Date`` class has only static and transient fields. Therefore a record type of ``Date`` is not
  supported and will result in an exception when the dataset is created.

* A dataset can only be used in ad-hoc queries if its record type is completely contained in the dataset definition.
  This means that if the record type is or contains a parameterized type, then the type parameters must be present in
  the dataset definition. The reason is that the record type must be instantiated when executing an ad-hoc query.
  If a type parameter depends on the jar file of the application that created the dataset, then this jar file is not
  available to the query execution runtime.

  For example, you cannot execute ad-hoc queries over an ``ObjectStore<MyObject>`` if the ``MyObject`` is contained in
  the application jar. However, if you define your own dataset type ``MyObjectStore`` that extends or encapsulates an
  ``ObjectStore<MyObject>``, then ``MyObject`` becomes part of the dataset definition for ``MyObjectStore``. See the
  :ref:`Purchase <examples-purchase>` application for an example.


Parameterized Types
-------------------
Suppose instead of being fixed to ``String`` and ``int``, the ``Entry`` class is generic with type parameters for both
key and value::

  class GenericEntry<KEY, VALUE> {
    private final KEY key;
    private final VALUE value;
    ...
  }

We should easily be able to implement ``RecordScannable<GenericEntry<String, Integer>>`` by defining ``getRecordType()``.
However, due to Java's runtime type erasure, returning ``GenericEntry.class`` does not convey complete information
about the record type. With reflection, CDAP can only determine the names of the two fields, but not their types.

To convey information about the type parameters, we must instead return a ``ParameterizedType``, which Java's
``Class`` does not implement. An easy way is to use Guava's ``TypeToken``::

  class MyDataset ... implements RecordScannable<GenericEntry<String, Integer>>
    public Type getRecordType() {
      return new TypeToken<GenericEntry<String, Integer>>() { }.getType();
    }

While this seems a little more complex at first sight, it is the de-facto standard way of dealing with Java type
erasure.

Complex Types
-------------
Your record type can also contain nested structures, lists, or maps, and they will be mapped to type names as defined in
the `Hive language manual <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL>`_. For example, if
your record type is defined as::

  class Movie {
    String title;
    int year;
    Map<String, String> cast;
    List<String> reviews;
  }

The SQL schema of the dataset would be::

  (title STRING, year INT, cast MAP<STRING, STRING>, reviews ARRAY<STRING>)

Refer to the Hive language manual for more details on schema and data types.

StructuredRecord Type
---------------------
There are times when your record type cannot be expressed as a plain old Java object. For example, you may want to write
a custom dataset whose schema may change depending on the properties it is given. In these situations, you can implement
a record-scannable dataset that uses ``StructuredRecord`` as the record type::

  class MyStructuredDataset ... implements RecordScannable<StructuredRecord> {
    ...
    public Type getRecordType() {
      return StructuredRecord.class;
    }

The ``StructuredRecord`` class is essentially a map of fields to values, with a ``Schema`` describing the fields and values::

  public class StructuredRecord {
    ...
    public Schema getSchema() { ... }

    public <T> T get(String fieldName) { ... }

Datasets that use ``StructuredRecord`` as the record type must also set the schema dataset property when they are created::

  @Override
  public void configure() {
    Schema schema = Schema.recordOf("mySchema",
      Schema.Field.of("id", Schema.of(Schema.Type.STRING)),
      Schema.Field.of("name", Schema.of(Schema.Type.STRING)),
      Schema.Field.of("age", Schema.of(Schema.Type.INT)),
      Schema.Field.of("email", Schema.of(Schema.Type.STRING))
    );
    createDataset("users", MyStructuredDataset.class,
                  DatasetProperties.builder()
                    .add(DatasetProperties.SCHEMA, schema.toString())
                    .build());

Failure to set the schema property will result in errors when enabling exploration on the dataset. The dataset will still
be created, but it will not be explorable until the schema property is set correctly through the RESTful API.
In addition, it is up to the user to ensure that the schema set in the dataset properties
matches the schema of records returned by the dataset. Schema mismatches will result in runtime errors.

The CDAP ``Table`` and ``ObjectMappedTable`` datasets implement ``RecordScannable`` in this way and can be used as references.

.. _sql-scanning-records:

Scanning Records
----------------
The second requirement for enabling SQL queries over a dataset is to provide a means of scanning the dataset record
by record. Similar to how the ``BatchReadable`` interface makes datasets readable by MapReduce programs by iterating
over pairs of key and value, ``RecordScannable`` iterates over records. You need to implement a method to partition the
dataset into splits, and an additional method to create a record scanner for each split::

      List<Split> getSplits();
      RecordScanner<RECORD> createSplitRecordScanner(Split split);

The ``RecordScanner`` is very similar to a ``SplitReader``; except that instead of ``nextKeyValue()``,
``getCurrentKey()``, and ``getCurrentValue()``, it implements ``nextRecord()`` and ``getCurrentRecord()``.

Typically, you do not implement these methods from scratch but rely on the ``BatchReadable``
implementation of the underlying Tables and datasets. For example, if your dataset is backed by a ``Table``::

  class MyDataset implements Dataset, RecordScannable<Entry> {

    private Table table;
    private static final byte[] VALUE_COLUMN = { 'c' };

    // ..
    // All other dataset methods
    // ...

    @Override
    public Type getRecordType() {
      return Entry.class;
    }

    @Override
    public List<Split> getSplits() {
      return table.getSplits();
    }

    @Override
    public RecordScanner<Entry> createSplitRecordScanner(Split split) {

      final SplitReader<byte[], Row> reader = table.createSplitReader(split);

      return new RecordScanner<Entry>() {
        @Override
        public void initialize(Split split) {
          reader.initialize(split);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean nextRecord() {
          return reader.nextKeyValue();
        }

        @Override
        public Entry getCurrentRecord()  {
          return new Entry(
            Bytes.toString(reader.getCurrentKey()),
            reader.getCurrentValue().getInt(VALUE_COLUMN));
        }

        @Override
        public void close() {
          reader.close();
        }

      }
    }
  }

While this is straightforward, it is even easier if your dataset already implements ``BatchReadable``.
In that case, you can reuse its implementation of ``getSplits()`` and implement the split record scanner
with a helper method
(``Scannables.splitRecordScanner``) already defined by CDAP. It takes a split reader and a ``RecordMaker``
that transforms a key and value, as produced by the ``BatchReadable``'s split reader,
into a record::

  @Override
  public RecordScanner<Entry> createSplitRecordScanner(Split split) {
    return Scannables.splitRecordScanner(
      table.createSplitReader(split),
      new Scannables.RecordMaker<byte[], Row, Entry>() {
        @Override
        public Entry makeRecord(byte[] key, Row row) {
          return new Entry(Bytes.toString(key), row.getInt(VALUE_COLUMN));
        }
      });
  }

Note there is an even simpler helper (``Scannables.valueRecordScanner``) that derives a split
record scanner from a split reader. For each key and value returned by the split reader it ignores the key
and returns the value. For example,
if your dataset implements ``BatchReadable<String, Employee>``, then you can implement ``RecordScannable<Employee>`` by
defining::

  @Override
  public RecordScanner<Employee> createSplitRecordScanner(Split split) {
    return Scannables.valueRecordScanner(table.createSplitReader(split));
  }

An example demonstrating an implementation of ``RecordScannable`` is included in the CDAP Sandbox in the
directory ``examples/Purchase``, namely the ``PurchaseHistoryStore``.

Writing to Datasets with SQL
----------------------------
Data can be inserted into datasets using SQL. For example, you can write to a dataset named
``ProductCatalog`` with this SQL query::

  INSERT INTO TABLE dataset_productcatalog SELECT ...

In order for a dataset to enable record insertion from SQL query, it simply has to expose a way to write records
into itself.

For CDAP datasets, this is done by implementing the ``RecordWritable`` interface.
The system dataset KeyValueTable already implements this and can be used to insert records from SQL queries.

Let's take a closer look at the ``RecordWritable`` interface.

Defining the Record Schema
..........................

Just like in the ``RecordScannable`` interface, the record schema is given by returning the Java type of each record,
using the method::

  Type getRecordType();

:ref:`The same rules <sql-limitations>` that apply to the type of the ``RecordScannable`` interface apply
to the type of the ``RecordWritable`` interface. In fact, if a dataset implements both ``RecordScannable`` and
``RecordWritable`` interfaces, they will have to use identical record types.

Writing Records
...............

To enable inserting SQL query results, a dataset needs to provide a means of writing a record into itself.
This is similar to how the ``BatchWritable`` interface makes datasets writable from MapReduce programs by providing
a way to write pairs of key and value. You need to implement the ``RecordWritable`` method::

  void write(RECORD record) throws IOException;

Continuing the *MyDataset* :ref:`example used above <sql-scanning-records>`, which showed an implementation of
``RecordScannable``, this example an implementation of a ``RecordWritable`` dataset that is backed by a ``Table``::

  class MyDataset implements Dataset, ..., RecordWritable<Entry> {

    private Table table;
    private static final byte[] VALUE_COLUMN = { 'c' };

    // ..
    // All other dataset methods
    // ...

    @Override
    public Type getRecordType() {
      return Entry.class;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(Entry record) throws IOException {
      return table.put(Bytes.toBytes(record.getKey()), VALUE_COLUMN, Bytes.toBytes(record.getValue()));
    }
  }

Note that a dataset can implement either ``RecordScannable``, ``RecordWritable``, or both.

Formulating Queries
-------------------
When creating your queries, keep these limitations in mind:

- The query syntax of CDAP is a subset of the variant of SQL that was first defined by Apache Hive.
- The SQL commands ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` are not allowed on CDAP datasets.
- When addressing your datasets in queries, you need to prefix the dataset name with
  ``dataset_``. For example, if your dataset is named ``ProductCatalog``, then the
  corresponding table name is ``dataset_productcatalog``. Note that the table name is
  lower-case.
- If your dataset name contains a '.' or a '-', those characters will be converted to '_' for the Hive
  table name. For example, if your dataset is named ``my-table.name``, the corresponding Hive table
  name will be ``dataset_my_table_name``. Beware of name collisions. For example, ``my.table`` will
  use the same Hive table name as ``my_table``.
- You can also configure the table name by setting the dataset property ``explore.table.name``
  (see :ref:`Data Exploration <data-exploration>`).

For more examples of queries, please refer to the `Hive language manual
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML#LanguageManualDML-InsertingdataintoHiveTablesfromqueries>`__.
