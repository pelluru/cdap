Debugging a CDAP Application
============================

.. _debugging-sandbox:

Debugging an Application in CDAP Sandbox
========================================
Any CDAP application can be debugged in the CDAP Sandbox
by attaching a remote debugger to the CDAP JVM. To enable remote
debugging:

#. Start the CDAP Sandbox with ``--enable-debug``, optionally specifying a port (default is ``5005``).

   The CDAP should confirm that the debugger port is open with a message such as
   ``Remote debugger agent started on port 5005``.

#. Deploy (for example) the *HelloWorld* application to the CDAP by dragging and dropping the
   ``HelloWorld.jar`` file from the ``/examples/HelloWorld`` directory onto the CDAP UI.

#. Open the *HelloWorld* application in an IDE and connect to the remote debugger.

For more information, see `Attaching a Debugger`_.

**Note:** Currently, debugging is not supported under Windows.

.. _debugging-distributed:

Debugging an Application in Distributed CDAP
============================================

.. highlight:: console

In distributed mode, an application does not run in a single JVM. Instead, its programs
are dispersed over multiple—if not many—containers in the Hadoop cluster. There is no
single place to debug the entire application.

You can, however, debug every individual container by attaching a remote debugger to it.
This is supported for each flowlet of a flow and each instance of a service. In order
to debug a container, you need to start the component with debugging enabled by making
an HTTP request to the component’s URL. For example, the following will start a flow for debugging::

  POST /v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCounter/debug

Using ``curl``:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ curl -w"\n" -X POST "http://<hostname>:11015/v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCounter/debug"

Note that this URL differs from the URL for starting the flow only by the last path
component (``debug`` instead of ``start``; see the :ref:`http-restful-api-lifecycle`).
You can pass in runtime arguments in the exact same way as you normally would start a flow.

Once the flow is running, each flowlet will detect an available port in its container
and open that port for attaching a debugger.
To find out the address of a container’s host and the container’s debug port, you can query
the CDAP for a flow or service’s live info via HTTP::

  GET /v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCounter/live-info

or, using the CDAP CLI:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ cdap cli get flow live WordCount.WordCounter

The response is formatted in JSON and—pretty-printed— would look similar to this::

  {
    "app": "WordCount",
    "containers": [
      {
        "container": "container_1397069870124_0010_01_000002",
        "debugPort": 42071,
        "host": "node-1004.my.cluster.net",
        "instance": 0,
        "memory": 512,
        "name": "unique",
        "type": "flowlet",
        "virtualCores": 1
      },
      ...
      {
        "container": "container_1397069870124_0010_01_000005",
        "debugPort": 37205,
        "host": "node-1003.my.cluster.net",
        "instance": 0,
        "memory": 512,
        "name": "splitter",
        "type": "flowlet",
        "virtualCores": 1
      }
    ],
    "id": "WordCounter",
    "runtime": "distributed",
    "type": "Flow",
    "yarnAppId": "application_1397069870124_0010"
  }

You see the YARN application id and the YARN container IDs of each flowlet. More importantly, you
can see the host name and debugging port for each flowlet. For example, the only instance of the
*splitter* flowlet is running on ``node-1003.my.cluster.net`` and the debugging port is 37205. You can now
attach your debugger to the container’s JVM (see `Attaching a Debugger`_).

The corresponding HTTP requests for the ``RetrieveCounts`` service of this application would be::

  POST /v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/services/RetrieveCounts/debug
  GET /v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/services/RetrieveCounts/live-info

Analysis of the response would give you the host names and debugging ports for all instances of the service.

Debugging the Transaction Manager (Advanced Use)
================================================
In this advanced use section, we will explain in depth how transactions work internally.
Transactions are introduced in the :ref:`Transaction System <transaction-system>`.

A transaction is defined by an identifier, which contains the timestamp, in milliseconds,
of its creation. This identifier—also called the `write pointer`—represents the version
that this transaction will use for all of its writes. It is also used to determine
the order between transactions. A transaction with a smaller write pointer than
another transaction must have been started earlier.

The `Transaction Manager` (or TM) uses the write pointers to implement `Optimistic Concurrency Control`
by maintaining state for all transactions that could be facing concurrency issues.

Transaction Manager States
--------------------------
The `state` of the TM is defined by these structures and rules:

- The `in-progress set`, which contains all the write pointers of transactions
  which have neither committed nor aborted.
- The `invalid set`, which contains the write pointers of the transactions
  considered invalid, and which will never be committed. A transaction
  becomes invalid only if either it times out or, for a long-running transaction,
  it is being aborted.
- A transaction's write pointer cannot be in the `in-progress set`
  and in the `invalid set` at the same time.
- The `invalid set` and the `in-progress set` together form the `excluded set`.
  When a transaction starts, a copy of this set is given to the transaction so that
  it excludes from its reads any writes performed by transactions in that set.
- The `committing change sets`, which maps write pointers of the transactions
  which have requested to commit their writes and which have passed a first round of
  conflict check to a list of keys in which they have performed those writes.
- The `committed change sets`, which has the same structure as the `committing change sets`,
  but where the write pointers refer to transactions which are already committed and
  which have passed a second round of conflict check.


Transaction Lifecycle States
----------------------------
Here are the states a transaction goes through in its lifecycle:

- When a transaction starts, the TM creates a new write pointer
  and saves it in the `in-progress set`.
  A copy of the current excluded set is given to the transaction,
  as well as a `read pointer`. The pointer
  is an upper bound for the version of writes the transaction is allowed to read.
  It prevents the transaction from reading committed writes performed after the transaction
  started.
- The transaction then performs writes to one or more rows, with the version of those writes
  being the write pointer of the transaction.
- When the transaction wants to commit its writes, it passes to the TM all the keys where
  those writes took place. If the transaction is not in the `excluded set`, the
  TM will use the `committed change sets` structure to detect
  a conflict. A conflict happens in cases where the transaction tries to modify a
  row which, after the start of the transaction, has been modified by one
  of the transactions present in the structure.
- If there are no conflicts, all the writes of the transaction along with its write pointer
  are stored in the `committing change sets` structure.
- The client |---| namely, a dataset |---| can then ask the TM to commit the writes. These are retrieved from the
  `committing change sets` structure. Since the `committed change sets` structure might
  have evolved since the last conflict check, another one is performed. If the
  transaction is in the `excluded set`, the commit will fail regardless
  of conflicts.
- If the second conflict check finds no overlapping transactions, the transaction's
  write pointer is removed from the `in-progress set`, and it is placed in
  the `committed change sets` structure, along with the keys it has
  written to. The writes of this transaction will now be seen by all new transactions.
- If something went wrong in one or other of the committing steps, we distinguish
  between normal and long-running transactions:

  - For a normal transaction, the cause could be that the transaction
    was found in the excluded set or that a conflict was detected.
    The client ensures rolling back the writes the transaction has made,
    and it then asks the TM to abort the transaction.
    This will remove the transaction's write pointer from either the
    `in-progress set` or the `excluded set`, and optionally from the
    `committing change sets` structure.

  - For a long-running transaction, the only possible cause is that a conflict
    was detected. Since it is assumed that the writes will not be rolled back
    by the client, the TM aborts the transaction by storing its
    write pointer into the `excluded set`. It is the only way to
    make other transactions exclude the writes performed by this transaction.

The `committed change sets` structure determines how fast conflict detections
are performed. Fortunately, not all the committed writes need to be
remembered; only those which may create a conflict with in-progress
transactions. This is why only the writes committed after the start of the oldest,
in-progress, not-long-running transaction are stored in this structure,
and why transactions which participate in conflict detection must remain
short in duration. The older they are, the bigger the `committed change sets`
structure will be and the longer conflict detection will take.

When conflict detection takes longer, so does committing a transaction
and the transaction stays longer in the `in-progress set`. The whole transaction
system can become slow if such a situation occurs.

Dumping the Transaction Manager
-------------------------------

.. highlight:: console

CDAP comes bundled with a script that allows you to dump the state of the internal
transaction manager into a local file to allow further investigation. If your CDAP Instance
tends to become slow, you can use this tool to detect the incriminating transactions.
This script is called ``cdap debug transactions`` (on Windows, it is ``tx-debugger.bat``).

To download a snapshot of the state of the TM of the CDAP, use the command:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  .. Linux

  $ cdap debug transactions view --host <name> [--save <filename>]

  .. Windows

  > tx-debugger.bat view --host <name> [--save <filename>]

where `name` is the host name of your CDAP instance, and the optional `filename`
specifies where the snapshot should be saved. This command will
print statistics about all the structures that define the state of the TM.

You can also load a snapshot that has already been saved locally
with the command:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  .. Linux

  $ cdap debug transactions view --filename <filename>

  .. Windows

  > tx-debugger.bat view --filename <filename>

where `filename` specifies the location where the snapshot has been saved.

Here are options that you can use with the ``tx-debugger view`` commands:

- Use the ``--ids`` option to print all the transaction write pointers
  that are stored in the different structures.
- Use the ``--transaction <writePtr>`` option to specify the write pointer
  of a transaction you would like information on. If the transaction is found
  in the committing change sets or the committed change sets
  structures, this will print the keys where the transaction has
  performed writes.

While transactions don't inform you about the tasks that launched them |---| whether
it was a flowlet, a MapReduce program, etc. |---| you can match the time
they were started with the activity of your CDAP to track potential
issues.

If you really know what you are doing and you spot a transaction in the
in-progress set that should be in the excluded set, you can
use this command to invalidate it:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  .. Linux

  $ cdap debug transactions invalidate --host <name> --transaction <writePtr>

  .. Windows

  > tx-debugger.bat invalidate --host <name> --transaction <writePtr>

Invalidating a transaction when we know for sure that its writes should
be invalidated is useful, because those writes will then be removed
from the concerned Tables.
