    // This is done because of performance reasons.

    // nodes. So the controller/component that is using this directive need to pass in this flag and update it
    // whenever there is a change in the model. This way the watch becomes smaller.

    // The ideal solution would be to use a service and have this directive register a callback to the service.
    // Once the service updates the data it could call the callbacks by updating them with data. This way there
    // is no watch. This is done in hydrator and we should fix this ASAP.
