 * An {@link Aggregator} used in batch programs.

 * byte[], Boolean, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String, or StructuredRecord.
 * If the group key is not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce,
 * it must implement Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableComparable interface.
 * If the group value is not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce,
 * it must implement Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable interface.
 * If the aggregator is being used in spark, both the group key and value must implement the
 * {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.
