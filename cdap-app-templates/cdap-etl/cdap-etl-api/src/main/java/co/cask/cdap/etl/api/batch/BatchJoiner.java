 * A {@link Joiner} used for batch programs.
 * As it is used in batch programs, a BatchJoiner must be parameterized
 * with supported join key and input record classes. Join keys and input records can be a
 * byte[], Boolean, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String, or StructuredRecord.
 * If the join key is not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce,
 * it must implement Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableComparable interface.
 * If the input record is not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce,
 * it must implement Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable interface.
 * If the joiner is being used in spark, both the join key and input record must implement the
 * {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.
