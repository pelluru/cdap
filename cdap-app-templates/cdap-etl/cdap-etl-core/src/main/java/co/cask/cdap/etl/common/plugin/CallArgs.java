 * Arguments used by a {@link Caller} when running a Callable. Right now it only has a flag for whether or not
 * timing should be skipped, but it is here in case we add more functionality. For example, if we decide we want to
 * have separate timers for different methods.
 *
 * This is used right now because we want to time some methods but not others. For example, most plugins have some
 * lifecycle methods like initialize() and destroy() that are only called once. We don't want to track time for those
 * methods because they are just called once and will probably throw off the min time and standard deviation metrics
 * that we want to track.
