			Welcome to the CDAP SDK VM

This virtual machine uses a simple graphical interface. The menu can be accessed by
clicking the icon at the bottom left. Included are the Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs,
Chromium Browser, Git, Java, Maven, Subversion, and the CDAP SDK with the Standalone CDAP.

The login and password to the machine is 'cdap' and the user has sudo privileges
without a password.

The SDK can be stopped/started/restarted using the /etc/init.d/cdap-sdk init
script.

	sudo /etc/init.d/cdap-sdk start
	sudo /etc/init.d/cdap-sdk stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/cdap-sdk restart

Logs for the SDK are found at /opt/cdap/sdk/logs, data is stored at
/opt/cdap/sdk/data, and example applications are at
/opt/cdap/sdk/examples.
