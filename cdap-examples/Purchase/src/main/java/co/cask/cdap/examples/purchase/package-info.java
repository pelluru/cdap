/**
 *
 * An app that uses a scheduled Workflow to start a MapReduce that reads from one 
 * ObjectStore DataSet and writes to another.
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Send sentences of the form "Tom bought 5 apples for $10" to the purchaseStream.
 *   </li><li>
 *     The PurchaseFlow reads the purchaseStream and converts every input String into a Purchase object and stores
 *     the object in the purchases DataSet.
 *   </li><li>
 *     As scheduled by the PurchaseHistoryWorkflow, the PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce program
 *     reads the purchases DataSet, creates a purchase history, and stores the purchase history in the
 *     history DataSet every morning at 4:00 A.M. To avoid waiting, you can manually start the  
 *     PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce either from within the CDAP UI or programmatically by using the CDAP CLI.
 *   </li><li>
 *     Request the PurchaseHistoryService retrieve from the history Dataset the purchase history of a user.
 *     <p>
 *       Note: Because by default the PurchaseHistoryWorkflow process doesn't run until 4:00 A.M., you'll have to wait 
 *       until the next day (or manually or programmatically execute the PurchaseHistoryBuilder.)
 *       after entering the first customers' purchases or the PurchaseQuery will return a "not found" error.
 *     </p>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
