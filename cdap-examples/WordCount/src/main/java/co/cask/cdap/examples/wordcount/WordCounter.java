/**
 * Flow that takes any arbitrary string of input and performs word statistics.
 * <p>
 * Flow parses input string into individual words, then performs per-word counts
 * and other calculations like total number of words seen, average length
 * of words seen, unique words seen, and also tracks the words most often
 * associated with each other word.
 * <p>
 * The first Flowlet is the WordSplitter, which splits the sentence into
 * individual words, cleans up non-alpha characters, and then sends the
 * sentences to the WordAssociater and the words on to the WordCounter.
 * <p>
 * The next Flowlet is the WordAssociater that will track word associations
 * between all of the words within the input string.
 * <p>
 * The next Flowlet is the Counter, which performs the necessary data
 * operations to do the word count and count other word statistics.
 * <p>
 * The last Flowlet is the UniqueCounter, which calculates and updates the
 * unique number of words seen.
