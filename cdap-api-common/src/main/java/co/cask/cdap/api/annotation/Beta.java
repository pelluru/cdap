/**
 * Annotates a public API that may be subjected to incompatible changes up to the extent of removal from
 * the library in future releases.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation, if declared on an API, exempts it from compatibility guarantees made by its library.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that having this annotation does <b>not</b> imply differences in quality with APIs 
 * that are non-beta, nor does it imply that they are inferior in terms of performance
 * with their non-beta counterparts. This annotation just signifies that the
 * APIs have not been finalized and could be subject to change in the future.
