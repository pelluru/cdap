Cask Data Application Platform Software Development Kit - @@project.version@@
================================================================================

The Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) includes a CDAP Local Sandbox: a
fully-functioning, standalone edition of the CDAP runtime. You can use this edition to
write, debug and test your Big Data applications before deploying them to a remote staging
or production CDAP.


Installation
============

To install and use CDAP and the included examples, there are a few simple
prerequisites:

  1. JDK 7+ (required to run CDAP, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js (required to run the CDAP UI; we recommend any version greater than v0.10.0)
  3. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, unzip the CDAP Local Sandbox to a suitable directory:

  %> cd <CDAP-HOME>
  %> unzip /tmp/cdap-local-sandbox-@@project.version@@.zip

or on Windows:

  > cd <CDAP-HOME>
  > jar xf cdap-local-sandbox-@@project.version@@.zip

Starting CDAP
=============

You are now ready to start CDAP. Do so by running the 'cdap'
script in the $CDAP/bin folder:

  %> cd <CDAP-HOME>/cdap-local-sandbox-@@project.version@@
  %> ./bin/cdap sandbox start

or on Windows:

  > cd <path to SDK>\cdap-sdk-@@project.version@@
  > bin\cdap.bat sandbox start
